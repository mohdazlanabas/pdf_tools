A MESSAGE FROM RA URU HU
FOR THE READERS OF THIS BOOK

TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIVE LIFE AS THEMSELVES:

Human Design offers a mechanical understanding of the nature of being.
With understanding comesa genuine revolution, the realignment ofalifeand
the awakening of awareness. Human Design offers a methodology uniquely
tailored to your design that liberates you from ‘not-self” conditioning. It is
called Strategy & Authority and it is the catalyst of transformation.

Most important to recognize is that this is knowledge to be experimented
with. There is a ‘way’ but it can only be your way. Allow this work to guide and

inform you and then, if it is correct for you, enter into the most extraordinary
journey of your life.

DEDICATION

This book is dedicated to Ra Uru Hu,
the founder and messenger of
The Human Design System,
to our grandchildren,
and to all future generations.
Ra URU Hu

HUMAN DESIGN FOUNDER, MESSENGER & TEACHER
OF THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM

Ra Uru Hu, born Robert Allan Krakower, was the fourth child of a
cultured, upper middle class family from Montreal, Canada. He was
surrounded b the arts and learned to express himself through music
as a composer and performer, an avocation he pursued until his death.
He completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Sir George Williams
University, but his career path led him into the business world as an
advertising executive, magazine publisher and media producer.

One morning in 1983, he simply walked away from his family and fast-paced life as an entrepreneur
— from life as he knew it — al ‘disappeared.’ Several months later he found himself on the beautiful
and temperate island of Ibiza, in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. This ‘Eden’,
as he liked to call it, is where his ‘real’ life as Ra Uru Hu had its beginnings.

On the evening of January 3, 1987, he encountered the ‘Voice.’ It was a terrifying experience. The
Voice said, “Are you ready to work?” And for eight days and eight nights he worked, transcribing in
detail what is now known as The Human Design System. Ra speaks of the encounter as a wake-up
call, an education which showed him how blindand ignorant his assumptions were about the nature
of being, the cosmos and the way things work.

Ra considered himself the messenger of The Human Design System, now his legacy, and dedicated
his life since the encounter to disseminating the Science of Differentiation around the world. He
lived and worked in Ibiza where he enjoyed teaching, playing music, gardening and spending time
with his wife, three children and his grandson.

As Ra has said many times, “Don't believe a thing I tell you, try it for yourself.” There are now
thousands of people across the world who have worked with The Human Design System, and found
that it does indeed accurately reveal the mechanics of the way life works.

Ra passed away in his home on March 12, 2011 at 5:40 AM, less than a month from his 63rd birthday.

LYNDA BUNNELL

HUMAN DESIGN TEACHER AND DIRECTOR
OF THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN DESIGN SCHOOL

Lynda Bunnell is the Director of the International Human Design
School. Working closely with Ra Uru Hu since 1999, she was one of.
the first to begin teaching and training Human Design Analysts and
Teachers world-wide, including the first class of analysts under the
new educational program re-structured by Ra in 2003. In 2005, she
and Ra were among the first to teach Human Design on-line creating
a virtual space where students from all over the world could meet and study together. In 2006 at his
request, ha re-introduced the Living Your Design Guide training program. Peas has pioneered
many of the training methods and modalities used in the on-line training programs today, and is the
author of the Student and Teacher Editions of the Living Your Design Boole

Ra asked her to become the Dean of the International Human Design School in 2006, and in June of
2010 turned the school over to her completely, entrusting her with his educational programs as well as
maintaining the global standards for education within The Human Design System. Lynda is a fervent
pioneer in moving Human Dern out into the world, and works full time to support and expand the
community of students and professionals throughout the world, dedicating herself to preserving The
Human Design System as taught by Ra.

“For the 12 years that I worked with Ra, I had the profound good fortune to be in effect his

rivate student as we corresponded almost daily about the details of The Human Design System
fewledae and his vision for it. He taught me how important it is to maintain the pathenttyot
the knowledge he was given, and he confided to me his dreams, wishes, and overall vision for ‘The
Human Design System. In the process, he transformed my life and the way I view the world around
me. And he instilled in me the tools I need to continue to bring this knowledge to all who can use
it, and for this I am eternally grateful.”

Lynda’s background includes thirty plus years as a successful businesswoman, and a passion for
spiritual and metaphysical studies. She was raised and still resides in Southern California, and is the
mother of two and grandmother of four.
THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
AROUND THE WORLD...

“Tt is with great pleasure that I can finally say, ‘Here it is." This book is for all of those seeking a comprehensive

and authoritative description of The Human Design System and its formula. This volume sets out the step-by-

step progression of the work from foundation knowledge to the finest nuance of who we are, and how we may

encounter our lives as ourselves. To my knowledge, it is the only published work that has enjoyed the active

collaboration of the founder and first student of the system, Ra Uru Hu. I cannot recommend it more highly.”
—J:R. Richmond, Sedona, AZ, USA, Chairman and current Registrar of the IHDS

“T have been using The Human Design System both for myself, and as a resource with my students, for the
last several years. As a teacher and counselor of inner-personal development this system has become one of
my most accurate and reliable tools. Once understood it can give the user personal insight into issues we all
face daily. You can find new comfort in your experiences by knowing your design. You learn how to just ‘be’
in life while still doing. Lynda has taken The Human Design System which is multidimensional, and found a
way to simplify it into a meaningful easy to follow book. This is THE system, developed by Ra Uru Hu, that
takes us all into, and supports us as individuals, in the future.”

Dr. Barbra Dillenger; Del Mar; CA, USA, McD, Transpersonal Development, Founder of Metanoia Services

“Since meeting my design, my level of honesty and trust in my authority to make decisions has increased
in proportion to my level of self love. Honesty is self love. And for me that has come through multiple
baptisms of fire. It has been very uncomfortable at times, yet is the only true path I've found to the freedom
and responsibility and ‘no choice’ of being my real self. The Human Design system is like the Wiki-leaks
for the true self. It tells the whole truth. No nuance of myself can escape.”

— Becky Markley, Seattle, OR, USA

“Human Design, what has it done for my life? That is so simple and complex to explain. Simple because it just

allowed me to really know who I am without all the conditioning and my mental distortion of who I thought I

was! Human Design is such a complete system that it is like a never-ending story of discovering who I am. 1 say

this several times and this is my inner truth: Human Design is the best thing that has ever happened to my life.”
—Idalina Fernandes, Porto, Portugal

“Human Design readings have blessed me with profound insights about lifelong tendencies. They have given
me so many gifts, especially an awareness of the optimal approach for making my decisions and charting
my course. I would invite anyone who is truly dedicated to personal awakening to open themselves to the
powerful gifts of Human Design.”

— Dr. Roger Teel, Senior Minister, Mile Hi Church, Lakewood, CO, USA

“While working on this project I was once again struck by the beauty, scope and magnitude of The Human
Design System, but it is the simple, practical and effective methods for reclaiming oneself, exquisitely tailor-
made for each individual human being, which ended my seeking and brought me home.”

— Donna Garlinghouse, Alexandria, MN, USA

“Human Design has been a very personal and intimate journey for me for more than a decade. Understanding
and then living my uniqueness has brought acceptance and grace into my life. Not only do I live life as myself,
but I also accept my family, friends and others as themselves. That is quite a gift.”

— Cathy Kinnaird, Vancouver, WA, USA
THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
AROUND THE WORLD ...

“Human Design has given me a unique yet systemized perspective of myself, others in my life and in the
world. It has provided awareness, and understanding on many different levels. I particularly like it when I can
determine why something is happening and have one of those ‘ah ha’ moments. I have found it to be a valuable
tool for change. No matter how people choose to work with it — from just using a few basic guidelines to diving
in and becoming a serious student - Human Design is a useful and fascinating method of self discovery.”

— Martha Morow, Vista, CA, USA

“Through the years I have worked with many different modalities and many gifted teachers, and I have learned
from all of them. What has helped me in terms of Human Design is a sense of my individuality. Let me give a few
examples: When I learned that I am a “social/hermit” I realized how important my private time is to me. When I
get up in the morning and make a pot of coffee, the next half hour is spent in reading quietly without interruptions.
‘That means that I am not available to anyone but myself and the book I am reading. It took a while for my wife to
get used to this but she does now respect it. When we looked at our combined charts my wife and J learned that
talking together in a public setting, such as a restaurant, helps us to be more effective in our communication. It gives
a whole new meaning to dining out. What a great system.”
— Michael MaKay, Del Mar, CA, USA

“Finding Human Design has had an immense impact on my life. Through it, I discovered ways I was fighting
my true nature. By experimenting with and embracing my unique design, I stopped comparing myself to
others and let go of the need to ‘better’ myself in order to fit in. It brought a new sense of honoring and
accepting the differences of other people as well. Sharing this information has been truly rewarding. When
faces light up and smiles emerge, it lets me know a recognition of one’s true, authentic self has been seen,
perhaps for the very first time.”

—Erica Teel, Lakewood, CO, USA

“I have enjoyed learning more about Human Design. It has helped me become more aware of my personal
makeup, and understand more about the way I have been conditioned versus the way I really am. The awareness
alone has helped me in understanding how I can approach day-to-day experiences from my internal authentic
self versus from my head. I am also having readings done on my children. I think it is important to learn
more about who they really are. I am hoping it will enhance our communication. Taking the knowledge and
practicing what I have learned, it’ really fun.”

~ Kathy Kinley, Carlsbad, CA, USA

“T know it wasn't luck that led me to discover the Human Design System back in 2004, though I do feel lucky.
It offers a richness of life that’s physically satisfying, mentally stimulating, and spiritually fulfilling. Now having
validated that personally, I share it with my Professional Coaching clients and Human Design students in a way
that brings real change to their life. Human Design is a highly evolved system, beyond what I was exposed to
growing up (and perhaps you too). Yet to me its power is in its practical application to everyday life, despite the
limited mental conclusions and past conditioning we might have developed. It transcends my desire to blend in
and play it safe. It lets me rise up, shine, and witness my light, and bring that out in others.”
— Carol Zimmerman, Los Gatos, CA, USA

“Thank you Ra, thank you Lynda, thank you Human Design for giving me ‘my’ life back.”
—Bethi Black, Ashland, OR, USA

RA URU HU WROTE
THE FOLLOWING FOREWORD FOR ITS READERS:

With The Human Design System's rising popularity, there are unauthorized
books emerging. There are very few students of mine that I have encouraged
and authorized to write books on the knowledge. It is a pleasure for me
to have a work of this quality and depth made available to the public and
written by one of the leading educators in Human Design. I have watched
Lynda’s process for many years, as student, analyst, teacher and ultimately
Director of the International Human Design School. She has made and
continues to make a major contribution to the continued integrity of the
knowledge and its growth in the world.

PREFACE
BY LYNDA BUNNELL

Imagine for a moment how different your life might have been for you and your parents if a User's
Guide had accompanied your birth. Imagine what it would have been like as a child to have been
encouraged to connect with the part deep inside you that always knew what was correct or not correct
for you; a place you could have trusted to say “yes” or “no” to whatever you met in this life. Imagine
for a moment how wonderful it would have been to know how incredibly unique you were born to
be, how unlike any other person alive, and to celebrate that uniqueness by loving yourself without
comparison. And imagine how wonderful it would be today to have your uniqueness celebrated and
encouraged by your family and friends. This is the possibility that The Human Design System holds

for you and future generations.

‘Though Human Design wasn’t here when most of us were born, it can touch and transform a life
at any age. My own personal experience with this remarkable system began when I was in my
early forties. As a successful and well-established businesswoman in Southern California in the
1990's, I thought I had achieved everything anyone needed to be happy — yet I knew I wasn't happy.
‘There was a disconnect between what my mind thought and my own inner truth. No amount of
exploration through other systems of self-discovery had succeeded in making that connection or
filling the void I sensed within.

A new chapter of my journey began in 1998 while vacationing in southern Spain. My traveling
companion, a spiritual seeker like myself, had brought some cassette tapes with her describing a
whole new system for personal transformation. We listened as we roamed the hillsides in our car.
Little did I suspect that this man’s amazing encounter while on a tiny island in the Mediterranean
— only a few miles away from us at that time — would turn my life upside down and inside out. The
man’s name was Ra Uru Hu and the system was Human Design.

It took a bit of convincing by my friend, but once I received a Human Design reading I was hooked.
I discovered that Human Design was what I had been seeking. I left my career behind without a
backward glance and immersed myself in reading and listening to everything I could find about
the knowledge. I participated in private readings and took extensive classes with Ra in Europe and
America for days and weeks at a time. It was an incredible, life-reorienting experience of step by
step, decision by decision, dismantling my firmly held misconceptions about myself and life.

As I surrendered to my inner wisdom, life took me in unexpected directions to satisfying destinations I
could not have dreamed of for myself. There were moments of deep and difficult inner transformations
as well. Human Design had not only shown me why my early successes in life had left me feeling
empty, it set me on a unique path that has brought me to this moment, fulfilled, challenged and
satisfied by my work — part of which is writing this book. This science is precious to humankind. I've
watched Human Design grow over the years, and I am still as passionate about it as I was when I first
encountered this amazing body of knowledge. As it has grown in popularity, and as materials began to
be published by others around the world, Ra asked me to compile a definitive and comprehensive book
in collaboration with him, that would represent and accurately record the knowledge.
PREFACE _%

As we were getting ready to go to press with this book, Ra died suddenly at his home in Ibiza, Spain. He
has been my teacher, mentor and friend since 1999, and I will forever miss his larger than life presence. He
lived what he taught, and used his own life experiences to validate the knowledge. Little did I know while
working toward this book release that the meaning of it for me would expand into a tribute honoring this
man and his contribution to humanity.

Over the years, Human Design has proven itself to me and never let me down. It is incredibly accurate
and deeply transformative. There are now thousands who have found their own truth by stepping onto
the path of awakening through Human Design.

Once you, too, begin to grasp your uniqueness, and to understand that you were not meant to be like
anyone else, you will experience the exhilarating freedom of living the person you were born to be.
It is never too late for you to start living into the fullest expression of yourself.

Welcome to the journey,
Lynda Bunnell

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

First I have to thank Ra Uru Hu. We spent a great deal of time collaborating on various projects
over the years, and I thank my lucky stars that the fates and my own trajectory put me in alignment
with this rare, brilliant and unusual man. He brought real, lasting and meaningful mutation to my
life and the lives of tens of thousands. I predict his legacy will continue on far into the distant future
and touch many generations. We had the love of Human Design in common and I am satisfied
that I expressed my gratitude to him time and time again over the years. He was a good man, he
never wanted to be followed as a Guru, and his students knew how much he loved his family and
his life. It’s a rare event indeed that a person comes into the world to be the clarion planting the
seed of a body of knowledge such as this. “It never hurts to be grateful,” he said to me during one
of my talks with him — and grateful I am. I am also deeply grateful to Ra’s family, his wife Ambuja,
daughter Sarah, son-in-law Mau, sons Loki and Jiva, and grandson Kian, for providing him with a
loving family and support system which allowed him to do his work. Human Design could not have
happened without them.

‘This book has been a labor of love and has taken a monumental effort to bring it into existence.
I have to pay a special tribute to Donna Garlinghouse as contributing editor and advisor on this
project. Donna worked with me step-by-step for the past few years as this book took shape. She has
a ‘left-mind’ and I have a ‘right-mind’ which made for an excellent collaborative effort. Donna is a
force of nature and a gift to us all. She helped me to see things clearly during some difficult times.
She is an amazing woman and we are all blessed to have her as part of our community.

A heartfelt thank you goes to Bethi Black. Her contributions as advisor, editor, and in book design
and layout, were priceless. Although we have worked together on other projects, little did I know
that when I called her last summer (2010) to ask her to help me with the school that we would
end up working on shis project together. In looking back I see how it was so perfectly and divinely
orchestrated. Bethi literally moved into my house so we could eat, breath, sleep, and work this book
into existence during the final home stretch. On many levels, it would have been impossible to get
through this past year without her.

And thank you to Becky Markley, contributing editor for the Living Your Design manuals, for your
sharp eye for detail and help with feedback and editing; Cathy Kinnaird and Carol Zimmerman,
for your inspiration, love and support; Genoa Bliven, for your true humanity and understanding the
importance of preserving and honoring Ra’s work and legacy; and both Mary Ann Winiger and

Randy Richmond, treasures in our community, for providing objective guidance for us all.

Sarah Krakower and Maurizio Cattaneo, with Human Design Concepts, provided a brilliant book
cover and amazing graphics. Ra used to say, “Human Design is a visual medium, a visual road map
to understanding our true nature,” and Mau clearly knows and embraces this in his core as we see
with the beautiful illustrations in this book. Sarah and Mau make a great team, and it is very apropos
that their love and energy are part of this book.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 5

‘There are many people in the community who have contributed in more ways than I can name as
friends and associates. They include the entire International Human Design School Faculty: Bethi
Black, Glenda Anderson, Deborah Bergman, Genoa Bliven, Alokanand Diaz, Carol Freedman,
Martin Grassinger, Cathy Kinnaird, Josette Lamotte, Becky Markley, Dr. Andrea Reikl-Wolf,
J.R. Richmond, Peter Schober, Ilse Sendler, Dharmen and Leela Swann-Herbert, and Carol
Zimmerman. I also want to acknowledge the National Human Design Organization Directors:
Glenda Anderson, Richard Beaumont, Genoa Bliven, Nicholas Caposiena, Maurizio Cattaneo,
Viviana Farran, Unnur Inga Jensen, Sarah Krakower, Josette Lamotte, Spyraggelos Marketos, Inaki
Moraza, Meris Oliveira, Virginia Page, Ilse Sendler, and Koji Ueda. We all have something in
common — we want what is best for the perseverance and growth of The Human Design System.

‘Thank you to my sister Kathy Kinley, daughter Alisa Hawkins, and son-in-law Matt Hawkins,
for their love, support and encouragement — and patience as my life was consumed by this project
as I approached the finish line; and to my grandchildren, Sara, Sabrina, Kingston and Landon.
Spending our magical times together fed my soul and was my much-needed reprieve. And thank
you to Jerry and Ida Bunnell for bringing me into this world; John and Shirley Barry for taking
me under your loving wings many years ago; Michael and Barbra MaKay for your encouragement
and inspiration; Martha Morrow, a supportive, dear and loving friend; and my Projector friend
Judy Thompson, for persisting and asking me, three times, if I wanted to have a Human Design
reading. A special thank you to my lifelong friend and daily confidant Dona King. She has been
right there beside me the whole way through this project asking every day, “Are you going to work
on the book today?” I wonder what she will ask me now that it is done!

Although there are too many to name, this book owes its greatest debt to the students, analysts
and teachers of The Human Design System — these are the true heros and pioneers. As we
each live our lives according to our true nature, we change the world for the better one person
at a time. Human Design could not have progressed to where it is today without all of you
doing your great work in the Human Design community. I know that I have been touched in
some way by all of you. We stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, and we
uplift and support those that are joining us in this incredible movement of The Human Design
System out into the world. Ra handed us the baton the day he passed from this earth, and now
it’s up to us to continue what he started.
THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

“THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM IS NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM. IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. IT IS NEITHER STORIES
NOR PHILOSOPHY. IT IS A CONCRETE MAP TO THE NATURE OF BEING, A
MAPPING OF YOUR GENETIC CODE. THIS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DETAIL
THE MECHANICS OF OUR NATURE IN SUCH DEPTH IS OBVIOUSLY
PROFOUND BECAUSE IT REVEALS OUR COMPLETE NATURE IN ALL ITS
SUBTLETIES. HUMAN DESIGN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE POTENTIAL
OF SELF-LOVE, A LOVE OF LIFE AND THE LOVE OF OTHERS THROUGH
UNDERSTANDING.” — RA URU HU

INTRODUCTION
THE LIFE TRANSFORMING EXPERIMENT OF
LIVING AS YOURSELF AND CLAIMING YOUR UNIQUENESS

The Human Design System is the Science of Differentiation. It shows each of us that we have a unique
design and a specific purpose to fulfill while on Earth. Endless possibilities for individual uniqueness
lie within our genetic matrix. There are millions of variations of human beings, yet each of us has a
specific and unique Human Design configuration with a clear Strategy that effortlessly aligns us to
our uniqueness. Human Design does not ask you to believe anything. It invites you to participate in a
potentially life-transforming living experiment, and provides you with the practical tools and information
needed to live life as yourself: Without this individualized — and individualizing — living experiment,
Human Design is just a complex system of fascinating information to entertain the mind.

In looking at thousands of charts, one thing stands out — no two are exactly alike. Even if someone
had a chart very much like yours they would not be you. But how do we determine our unique design?

operates. Never before have we been able to see all of the parts of ourselves so clearly. The conscious
and unconscious parts of ourselves, the aspects of us that no one can take away from us, as well as
the aspects that we have been taught or conditioned to believe are us, but are not.

As Ra Uru Hu has often said, “What you can rely on you've never relied on in your life. What
you can’t trust you've been trying to trust all your life. What you've been trusting has never been
you. What you've been ignoring has always been you. Try to trust what’s really you and see what

happens.” Each of us is meant to be different from everyone else. Now we can see and get in
touch with those differences. We are here to live our lives and express our truths in our own unique
ways. Understanding this can lift a great weight from our shoulders. How often have we compared
ourselves to someone else? How often as children were we compared to someone else by a parent,
teacher or peer? Comparing ourselves to others creates an impression deep inside of us that it is not
okay to be who we are. When we add that to the conditioning of our early years, we find ourselves
trying to change or adapt how we act to suit others, which further distances us from the person we
were born to be. When we begin to understand and accept our own uniqueness, something inside
of us opens up and relaxes. The layers and layers of conditioning slowly fall away, and the person we
were meant to be, our inner essence, begins to emerge.

WHAT YOUR CHART REVEALS

+ Your chart shows your specific genetic design: affirming who you really are, how to be yourself,
and how to navigate successfully through a constantly changing world.

+ Itprovides you with the tools you need to live an aware and awake life — a simple Strategy you can
trust that reliably connects you to your personal Authority in order to make moment-to-moment
decisions that are correct for you so that your unique life purpose can unfold naturally.

+ — Your Strategy will help you eliminate resistance (frustration, anger, disappointment, bitterness)
and fear in order to live in a relaxed, unique, creative and evolutionary/revolutionary way.

+ Your chart maps out your relationship dynamics to help you understand how the attractions,
resonances and conflicts between you and others play out.

+ It gives you guidance on how to align yourself with people who enhance your vitality, support
your life purpose, and share your true path.

+ Understanding the charts of others illustrates the truly unique and individual natures of those
close to you, like family and friends, and how best to respect and interact with them.

+ Most importantly, a chart shows us how to create the best environment for children so that they
are empowered to be their unique selves, and to learn and develop as individuated human beings.

WHO YOU ARE — THE FOUR HUMAN DESIGN TYPES

Your chart gives you your Type, Strategy, and Authority (body-centered intelligence) tools to show
you the way you are designed to navigate through life and interact with the world. While there are
millions of variations of designs, there are just four Types of human beings. Each of us is one of these
Types, and your Type stays the same throughout your entire life. Here is a very brief explanation of
the Four Types. (The Types are covered in depth in Section Four.)

GENERATORS, THE BUILDERS, represent about 70 percent of the population. Their Strategy is to
engage with life by waiting for things to come to them so that they can respond. When they initiate
rather than wait to respond, they usually end up feeling frustrated. Generators are the life-force
of the planet and are designed to know themselves by observing what they respond to. Through
responding they experience satisfaction in their life and work. Their work is their gift to the world.

PROJECTORS, THE GUIDES, are approximately 20 percent of the population. Their Strategy for
engaging with, life is to wait for their specific gual ies to be recognized and invited into things. It

rather than wait, hed experience resistance and rection and can end up becoming bitter. The
Projector’s gift to the world is to understand and be a guide for others.

MANIFESTORS, THE INITIATORS, compose about 9 percent of the population. Their Strategy is
to inform others of their decisions before they take action in order to eliminate resistance. When
Manifestors cannot manifest in peace, they experience anger. Manifestors are designed to have a
powerful impact and be initiating mechanisms for the other Types. Initiating is their gift to the world.

REFLECTORS, THE DISCERNERS, represent approximately 1 percent of the population. Their
Strategy is to wait through a full cycle of the Moon before making major decisions. Reflectors
delight in life’s surprises. When they initiate and don't use their Strategy, they end up disappointed
with life. Reflectors are designed to be the judges of humanity, to reflect back the injustices humanity
inflicts on itself. Their ability to clearly discern the ‘this and that’ of the world is their gift.

THE EXPERIMENT OF LIVING YOUR STRATEGY AND AUTHORITY

‘The heart and soul of The Human Design System lies in the potential awakening that is available to
you through the actual living of your unique design. Strategy and Authority, which will be explained
in detail later in this book, are the doorways to living as yourself, affirming who you really are, and
understanding and letting go of what you are not.

In the past we navigated life with our minds as the ultimate decision maker. Our minds are not equipped
to do this for us any longer. The mind’s real genius is for collecting information and experiences,
measuring this against that, and contemplating unique perceptions and reflections that can be shared
with others. It can only do this, however, when it is not making decisions for us. The mind is now at
its best as a passenger — here to watch the movie and to view the scenes of life as an involved observer.
INTRODUCTION: THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM 11

What actually moves us through life on our unique path is the superior consciousness or intelligence
of our body, the form we inhabit. The Human Design System is the revelation of how our form
works, and how it becomes the guiding source of our personal Authority. We are each designed with
a unique way to make decisions with our body consciousness, and every decision is critical as each
one moves us along life on a particular trajectory. One wrong decision can set our life on a course
that can have serious consequences. Mental decision-making is rarely more than a 50/50 guess, and
the mind is not a trustworthy personal guidance system. To survive on this planet, we each need to
know how to access our own Authority. It is the decisions that come from deep within that either
put us back on or keep us on the correct path for our life, empowering us to live life authentically
from our personal truth.

The Human Design System's tools for awakening are like no others. Once you are familiar with your
unique design and learn how to use your Strategy and Authority effectively, you can immediately
begin to experiment with and discover for yourself how they transform your life. By living as you
are designed to live, as yourself, your mind starts to play a much different and more appropriate role
as an objective observer and resource, freeing you to experience what it is to be an awake and aware
passenger. Your mind participates in your process of self-discovery but does not interfere with your
day-to-day decisions. Human Design gives you the tools and points the way, but it’s up to you to
use them.

“IF YOU LIVE BY YOUR PERSONAL STRATEGY AND AUTHORITY THERE IS NOTHING
TO DO - THE DOING HAPPENS AND ‘YOU’ ARE NOT INTERFERING.” — RA URU HU

THE AUTHENTIC SELF

‘Throughout the book we will compare the authentic (or true self) to the not-self. When we talk
about the authentic self or true self we mean our pure and natural behavioral nature designed to
emerge without resistance into the world. Another term used for this is our purpose, our reason
for being here — being the person we were born to be. The not-self is conditioned programming
masking our authentic self. As we become aware of our not-self through our Strategy and Authority,
we slowly become aware of our authentic self always present, but concealed just behind it. Self-
hatred also has its source in the not-self; we simply hate our failure to fulfill the layers and layers of
expectations that we have taken on or placed on ourselves. When we know and accept — and live —
from a comfortable place of authenticity, we will naturally come to love ourselves.

As you journey further into your personal experiment to know yourself, you will witness every
possible variation of your not-self conditioning and the resistance it creates. The more clearly you
see that, the more clearly you will see your true self. Knowing yourself is the path to loving yourself.
The Human Design System shows you how.

Human Design focuses on the health, stability and direction of our life contained within our bodies.
Once the form (body) is functioning optimally, the light of our psyche (Personality) or soul shines
through all we think, say and do with an empowering clarity and gentle ease. This is authenticity,
living as we were designed to live.
12 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE DECONDITIONING PROCESS

Deconditioning, as it is called in The Human Design System, is a process of letting go of what we
are not. It is a slow process because it is a deep process. When we re-claim our Authority, changing
how we make decisions and navigate through life, we actually change the way our cells function
within our body. Life moves in seven-year cycles, as it takes approximately seven years for all the
cells in our body to be renewed. The moment we begin to align with our own nature, the moment we
allow our body to live its life without resistance, we begin this deep process of deconditioning. Seven
years later we emerge closer to the person we were born to be. It is not easy to start as an adult, but
as we have heard over and over — it is NEVER too late to begin.

As far back as ancient China, thinkers and philosophers espoused the idea of not-doing as a way of
doing. There is a pleasant ease that comes from living your life surrendered to your inner guidance
system. Being awake and aware of yourself, living authentically and in harmony with your design,
is so much more interesting than living asleep and lost in the expectations of the conditioning of
the homogenized world. Learning to make decisions from deep within yourself, so that you and
others can fully benefit from you being you rather than a carbon copy of someone else, is worth
the effort, the time and the patience that it takes to get there. To know your self IS to love yourself.
Deconditioning will be discussed throughout this book.

SIGNPOSTS OF RESISTANCE

Once we begin living our life authentically through our Type, Strategy and Authority, we can begin
to pay attention to whether we experience ease or resistance along the way. When we have acted
from decisions made by our thinking minds, rather than our Strategy and Authority, we experience
resistance. Continually making decisions from our mind means we are living a life that isn’t ours; and
the accumulated stress from such actions jeopardizes our physical, mental and emotional well-being.
‘The not-self themes of Anger (Manifestor), Frustration (Generator), Bitterness (Projector), and
Disappointment (Reflector) are signposts of resistance that alert us that we have veered off course
by failing to follow our Strategy and ignoring our Authority. In other words, it is our not-self actions
and decisions that are resisted, not our authentic selves! If taken personally, we experience resistance
as rejection or suppression of our true self by others. On the other hand, when we become conscious
and aware of what resistance is telling us through these signposts, it affords us an opportunity to take
a step back and reassess our approach/action/words. When we become ill or dis-eased or accident
prone, we know that continued outside resistance has manifested on the inside. As our authenticity
is lived out, our purpose in life is freed to accomplish its essential mission and brings us our full
true-self measure of satisfaction, success, peace or surprise. (This topic is explored more thoroughly
in Section Four.)

THE BOTTOM LINE — AWAKENING

Human Design is a new kind of awakening. It is a process of coming to awareness that aligns
our mind and body with their appropriate roles. It requires making an ally of the mind through
understanding the mechanics of our design while simultaneously living our lives according to our
INTRODUCTION: THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM 13

Strategy and Authority. Once we understand the nature of the true self and the not-self, and are
making life decisions from our personal Authority, we can release our attachment to the mind and
its control over our lives, and free its incredible gifts to be of service to others. In doing so, we become
aware and awake passengers, and our minds become objective observers of our life. Each individual's
singular path to awakening begins with a growing awareness of our sophisticated body’s heightened
intelligence, and a deep trust in this intelligence to be our compass through life. We cannot, dare not,
release our mind’s hold until we know we can trust ourselves implicitly. By fully trusting our own
ability to navigate life, we become more accepting of ourselves, and able to genuinely love ourselves
—and others. This, in Human Design, is the point of personal transformation — seeing through the
illusion, and moving through life awake and aware.

THE FOUNDATIONS OF
A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE

HUMAN DESIGN FROM THE BEGINNING

Two incidents occurred in the first months of 1987 while Ra Uru Hu was li
tiny Mediterranean island off the coast of Spain. The first was his encounter with the Voice. In
“Encounter,” a video recording of his reflections on the event, he talks candidly about the shocking
experience which began late in the day of January 3, 1987. For eight straight days and nights a Voice,
as he called it, penetrated him; it revealed scientific information regarding the origins and workings
of the universe and gave him the formula for The Human Design System. He emerged from this
mystical experience with a new name, a different perspective on life, and a deeper understanding of
the mechanics of the universe. Several years of formulating and experimenting with the information
followed the encounter. From 1987 to 2011, Ra dedicated his life to moving this empowering body
of knowledge, in practical ways, out into the world.

‘The second incident was an extraordinary cosmic event that was seen with the naked eye from a
mountaintop observatory in Chile. It was a supernova — the death of a star, and a vast explosion
of incredible intensity. With its dying breath, that star bombarded our planet with subatomic
information, and for 14 minutes everybody on Earth received three times as many neutrinos as
normal. The impact or imprint of that event on human consciousness continues to unfold within
and around us to this day.

‘The Human Design System, the Science of Differentiation, is a new system of self-knowledge that
differs fundamentally from anything else that exists in the world because it is the only one designed
to directly address the transformation of 9-centered human beings. According to the Voice, 1781
marked a major evolutionary shift which forever impacted humanity’s direction, momentum and
innate capacity for self-awareness. It was the shift from the mind-directed and other-directed
7-centered human being to our more sophisticated, inner-directed 9-centered transitional forms.
All of us alive today inhabit 9-centered forms.

The Human Design System synthesizes aspects of two types of science: The ancient observational
systems of Astrology, the Chinese I’Ching, the Hindu-Brahmin Chakras and The Tree of Life
from the Zohar/Kabbalist tradition; and the contemporary disciplines of Quantum Mechanics,
Astronomy, Genetics and Biochemistry. As a logical, empirical and practical system, Human Design
does not ask you to believe anything. It merely offers you the opportunity to explore and experiment
with the mechanics of your nature, and your evolving consciousness, in order to find out for yourself
exactly what works for you.

Astrophysicists have established that our universe began 13.7 billion years ago following an astronomical
event they called the Big Bang. The most extraordinary thing to ponder about this event is that before
the Big Bang everything that had mass existed in one single particle that was smaller than an atom
Something ignited this speck and the resulting ‘explosion’ caused the universe to begin to expand. As
it expanded, and continues to expand at an ever-increasing rate, everything that existed separated into
two groups creating a basic duality: quarks and leptons, or a yin family and a yang family.

As the illustration shows, the yin family is fundamentally material (has mass) and is made up of
six quarks. Quarks are the smallest known building blocks of matter, and are usually found in
combinations. Scientists gave them the names “up, down, strange, charm, beauty and truth.” Two of
these six quarks, namely up and down, gather together into two groups (up, up, down; and down,
down, up) and form what are called the proton and the neutron of the atom. Protons carry a positive
electric charge while neutrons are electrically neutral elementary particles. On the other side of the
duality is the yang family, which is considered to be pure energy or light. This family is called leptons
(leptos is a Greek word meaning thin or small). There are six leptons as well: three different types of
d particles. When an

electrons and three different types of neutrinos. Electrons are negatively char
electron, a proton, and a neutron come together they form the atom.
20 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Scientists say if we add everything together that we know is atomic, which is to say has mass — the
stars, all the galaxies and super clusters, and everything else including us — we will discover their sum
represents less than one-tenth of the whole universe. The rest, or the space in between everything,
is made up of such things as dark matter and dark energy. That brings us to the enigmatic neutrino.

THE NEUTRINO — THE FIRST PREDICTION FULFILLED

During Ra's experience he learned that neutrinos were capable of leaving an imprint, which meant
that neutrinos were particles carrying mass. This had not been proven by science yet. At first
scientists thought these subatomic particles (neutrinos) streaming through space were pure energy
like the photon, but since they travel 1 to 2 percent slower than the speed of light, they could not
be pure energy. This first prediction was scientifically proven 11 years later. By 1998, scientists had
proven that the largest of these unusual and barely detectable particles bear an infinitesimal amount
of mass: about one-millionth the weight of one proton. Having mass allows neutrinos to carry
information, yet they are small enough to pass through any atomic barrier without resistance.

‘These tiny cosmic messengers are referred to as the breath of stars, the exhaled energy of stellar
fusion, and there are more of them than anything else in the universe. Three trillion neutrinos, and
the material information they carry, pass through every square inch of our planet — and us — every
second. Our Sun, which is the closest star to Earth, produces about 70 percent of all the neutrinos
that travel through our solar system. The remaining 30 percent are emitted by other stars in our

Milky Way Galaxy, and a small percentage are from the planet Jupiter.

Neutrinos could be regarded as the modern equivalent of what the ancients called chi or prana.
‘These extraordinary particles are penetrating us with bits of information all the time, which means
we live and move through a vast, continuous and inescapable information field.

CRYSTALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

‘The incredibly detailed scientific information received from the Voice about the nature of the cosmos
placed the Big Bang, acknowledged by physicists as the accepted beginning of the expansion of the
known universe, into a larger context. The Voice described the Big Bang as merely the conception of
our universe, not its birth. That means our entire universe is one single living entity, a fetus not yet
born, still expanding and moving toward its moment of birth.

In the beginning, said the Voice, there was a yin egg, a cosmic egg containing all of the (atomic)
material of the universe. This egg's structure is best described as crystalline. While not a crystal per se,
the term helps us visualize it. There was also a yang seed that contained another crystal-like structure.
When the yin egg and the yang seed came together at the Big Bang, there was a shattering and an
infinite number of crystalline aspects spread throughout the expanding universe, each aspect bearing
a “consciousness” of its original yin/yang orientation. Everything that we can imagine and all forms of
life on this planet — even inanimate objects — are endowed with these Crystals of Consciousness. We
will explain in Part Two of this Section how the Crystals get imbedded into the body.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 24

In a human being, the Personality Crystal of Consciousness, an aspect of the original yang seed,
sits above your head (just above the scalp) in the Head Center at the top of the BodyGraph. This
Personality Crystal manifests what you identify with as your Self, or who you think you are, and is
called the Passenger or passenger consciousness. The Design Crystal of Consciousness, an aspect
of the original yin egg, is seated in the Ajna Center (between the eyebrows) and manifests the
biogenetics of your body, or the physicality of the form. It is referred to as the vehicle or form
consciousness. The relationship between these two crystals is likened to a backseat passenger
(Personality) who rides in a vehicle (Design) operated and navigated by a third party - the driver.

THE MAGNETIC MONOPOLE — THE SECOND PREDICTION FULFILLED

‘The driver of the vehicle, the Magnetic Monopole, is the third key component described by the
Voice. On September 4, 2009, the Voices’ second prediction was substantiated when the scientific
community announced that it had observed the existence of magnetic monopoles. Briefly, monopoles
are particles that carry a single magnetic attraction, either a north or a south pole. They had eluded
detection since the search for them began in the early 1920's.

According to the Voice, our Magnetic Monopole is located in the sternum area known as the G
Center, and has two different functions. First, it holds us (and everything) together in the “illusion”
of our separateness. As a monopole or a magnet that only attracts, it holds the Personality Crystal
and the Design Crystal together in a relationship, much like a marriage holds two people together in
22 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

a mystical union. The second function of the Magnetic Monopole is to connect us to our movement
in time through space, guiding us along our path or our geometry in life — what we call destiny. This
connection can be likened to the way the arm of a streetcar hooks up to an electrically powered grid.
All life forms are endowed with a Magnetic Monopole.

THREE COMPONENTS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

MAGNETIC MONOPOLE,

Returning to the analogy of vehicle, passenger and driver, imagine a limousine with a driver behind
the wheel who knows exactly how to operate the vehicle, where to go and how to get there. The
vehicle represents the Design Crystal and the driver is the Magnetic Monopole. The Personality
Crystal — or who we think we are — is neither the vehicle nor the driver. The Personality Crystal has
no idea where to go or how to get there; it is simply the passenger. A passenger is meant to be
quiet and relaxed, and to watch the scenery go by instead of fighting with the driver for control of
the steering wheel. The Human Design System’s tools for living make the passenger comfortable
in the back seat of the vehicle so it can sit back and enjoy the ride.

SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 23

THE TRANSITION FROM 7-CENTERED TO 9-CENTERED BEINGS

With the discovery of the planet Uranus by Herschel in 1781, we moved into the ‘Uranian Era’ when
human beings with highly evolved 9-centered forms began replacing the 7-centered, mind-oriented
Homo sapiens. By the late 1800's the process was complete, making all of us alive today 9-centered
beings, or “Homo Sapien In Transitus,” a term coined by Ra Uru Hu to distinguish 9-centered beings
(an interregnum species) from Homo sapiens and the new, more highly evolved forms coming in 2027.

HOMO SA@pIET HOMO SAPIEN
7-CENTERE® IN TRANSITUS
9-CENTERED

This historically significant moment in our evolution marked the movement away from our need to
focus on survival through the mental awareness or mental intelligence of the strategic mind. Our
newer 9-centered forms, freed from addressing those basic fears for survival, are once again attuning
to the flow of the natural order. Subtle yet marked genetic changes are still taking place within
our physiology, which support comp!

For the purposes of this book, understanding Homo sapiens’lengthy evolutionary journey, compared
to our barely 230 year presence on this planet as Homo sapiens in transitus, gives us a perspective
on the pervasive impact that living in these transitory times as an interregnum species has on us.
It affects how we make decisions, relate to one another, break away from the controlling modes of
the past, and attain our full potential as conscious, awake and aware beings. Briefly, anthropologists
speculate that 5-centered Neanderthal hominids, who relied on instinctive splenic intelligence and
s to survive, were animistic and deeply connected to and influenced by the forces of

24 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

or ‘gods’ of nature. They lived as small family groups in harmony with the solar/lunar cycles of the
natural order, and appear to have been peaceful and non-aggressive.

As the Cro-Magnon mutation took place over thousands of years, the stage was set for the
evolution of modern man, for 7-centered Homo sapiens, our precursors. Their progress was
greatly enhanced beginning 85,000 years ago when the larynx mutated, increasing space in the
cranium for neurological advances in the neocortex and visual cortex which further delineated
the characteristic raised foreheads and binocular vision common to our species. Existential,
instinctual (or instantaneous) Splenic awareness was soon overshadowed by mental awareness
or intelligence that was given expression through the voice.

This metamorphosis continued to distinguish humans from the rest of the mammalian
kingdom. Being able to make and systematize a variety of repeatable sounds led to language.
Communication led to cooperation, and the unique ability to share intelligence, which then
led to specialization, and organization into villages and fiefdoms. All of these evolving traits
ensured new levels of personal and group mastery as part of Homo sapiens’ thriving existence.

With Cro-Magnon man, the emphasis shifted from survival of the form and living attuned to
the natural flow, to focusing on and revering the powers of the strategic mind that dominated
the natural flow. This is how Homo sapiens made it to the top of the food chain. Shrewd and
inventive strategic thinking replaced fears for survival with strategies formulated to control the
environment, and eventually the people in it. As a species, Homo sapiens were conditioned to
look to forces beyond themselves for authority, such as gods, priests and kings, to guide, rescue
and support them, as well as to justify their often aggressive conquests.

By 1781, the remarkable, strategic mind had succeeded in taking the 7-centered form to its zenith
of human potential. Enter 9-centered Homo Sapiens In Transitus. The 7-centered Homo sapiens
had a shorter life expectancy marked by the Saturnian cycle. Our new 9-centered forms or bodies
have an 84-year life expectancy marked by the Uranian cycle. We need to live longer in order
to process and integrate increasing amounts of information, and to develop technologies that
will be needed in the future. Driven by the genetic imperative to reproduce, 7-centered beings
found communion through sexuality. The 9-centered being is here to find communion through
awareness. The ways we communicate, and the shape our relating/relationships will take in the
future, are an intrinsic part of the transition to living completely as 9-centered beings.

By 1987, as the entire planet was flooded with the potential for heightened awareness, the
stage was already set, and the tension elevated between our body’s consciousness and our
mind’s domination. The moment was ripe for The Human Design System and its effective
and practical way of addressing this dilemma. The bottom line is that our now highly evolved
9-centered forms, our vehicles, are designed to guide us through life decision by decision. We
no longer need to look to an outer authority through our mind for direction. This is a huge
blow to the strategic mind in its determination to retain its former control of our decision-
making process. Through Type, Strategy and Authority, The Human Design System bridges
the evolutionary progression from the mental outer authority of the 7-centered being to the
revolutionary, aurically connected, personal authority of the 9-centered form.

‘The beautiful Mandala above is an amazing synthesis comprised of four ancient esoteric systems or
early sciences — four ways of understanding the rhythm and flow of life, the cosmos, and humanity’s
essential place within it. Western Astrology and the Chinese I’Ching are seen as the rings of the
Mandala, while the Hindu Brahman Chakra system and the Zohar/Kabbalist Tree of Life form the
basis for the BodyGraph centered within the Mandala.

‘This 64-gate matrix of a human being is the single most important feature within The Human Design
System. Each of these four systems and the components they contribute, plus the role neutrinos and
Magnetic Monopoles play in bringing it to life, will be discussed individually to demonstrate their
place in the Mandala, and how they function in relationship to each other in the whole. Together they
form the basis of a new, multi-faceted and deeply complex system providing a comprehensive means
of understanding the mystery of life and the mechanics of the universe: The Human Design System.
‘The synergy of this whole makes it much greater than the sum of its many parts.

26 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

“HUMAN DESIGN IS A MIRROR OF OUR AGE OF GLOBALIZATION AND SYNTHESIS.
THERE LURKS REAL DANGER IN CLINGING TO RELATIVE ABSOLUTES AS THIS IS THE
FORCE THAT CONTINUES TO CONDITION US AWAY FROM ACCEPTING OUR ONENESS.
HUMAN DESIGN IS NOT ABOUT SEEING OR ACCEPTING THAT THERE IS ONE SPECIFIC
WAY. THE WAY IS ALL WAYS. SYNTHESIS EMBRACES ALL OF THE COLLECTED WISDOM
OF THESE CULTURES AND THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT DOES NOT DISMISS OR LESSEN THE
VALUE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM DERIVED FROM THESE EARLIER SYSTEMS. IT
BRINGS THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO THEIR GLOBAL BODY, INTO THEIR PROPER PLACE
WHERE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY RECOGNIZED AND HONORED.
EACH CULTURE IN ITS EVOLUTION HAS EXPLORED AND DISCOVERED ASPECTS OF
THE TRUTH. THE SYNTHESIS OF THESE DIVERSE ASPECTS CREATES A COMPLETE
BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE LAW OF MATHEMATICS, THE
WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS.” — RA URU HU

ASTROLOGY — THE INNER RING OF THE MANDALA

The inner ring of the Mandala represents Astrology’s contribution to the synthesis. This
360-degree circle, with its 12 signs of the Western Zodiac (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc.), is the
way early human beings represented the universe, and tracked the movement of heavenly bodies
in the night sky. The Human Design System uses the Mandala to calculate and record two precise
moments in time and space within the synthesis. The first, based on the exact time of your birth,
is recorded as the Personality data. The second,
which is 88 degrees of solar arc or 3 months
prior to your birth, is recorded as the Design
data. The use of two calculations distinguishes
The Human Design System from traditional
astrology. (The calculation of data is discussed
in more detail in Part Three of this section.)

We are surrounded by an enormous star field
which generates the neutrino stream that
is constantly penetrating and informing
the objects it passes through. A kind of
communication occurs during the encounter
when the neutrino’s infinitesimal mass inter-
acts with or rubs against the object on its way
through. For example, when the neutrino
stream goes through Mars it communicates
with Mars and an exchange takes place. After
being filtered by Mars, the stream passes
through humans and there is another exchange. It’s as if a black car and a white car bang into
each other, and there is now a little black paint on the white car and a little white paint on the
black car. Each car is altered by the encounter just as we are altered by this neutrino interaction. In
this way, each planet contributes its essence to the way we are imprinted with the neutrino stream.
Even though we all exist in the same neutrino program, the unique way we manifest that program
is determined by the precise moment of our birth and the two calculations discussed above.

THE OUTER RING OF THE MANDALA

“THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE HUMAN DESIGN MANDALA IS EXTRAORDINARY
AND ITS SYMMETRIES ARE BEAUTIFUL. THE HEXAGRAMS AROUND THE WHEEL HAVE
AN ASSOCIATION DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH OUR GENETIC CODE, THE CODON. THE
WAY IN WHICH THE AMINO ACID CODON INFRASTRUCTURE OF A HUMAN BEING

‘The ancient Chinese ’Ching or Book of Changes, one of the first books ever written, reads like a
dictionary of archetypal wisdom on the seasons of life. What makes the I’Ching so extraordinary in this
synthesis, however, is not its philosophical or ethical text, but rather the amazing mathematical structure
of its 64 hexagrams. Specifically, the 64 numbered sections you see in the outer ring of the Mandala
represent the 64 hexagrams of the ’Ching. Each of these Hexagrams, pictured around the outside of
the wheel, is made up of a particular combination of six broken (yin) or solid (yang) lines. There are 64
hexagrams, each composed of 6 lines, which makes a total of 384 line markers around this outer ring.
Each Line contains a ‘bit’ of information specific to its particular position in the hexagram.

In the 1950's, Biologists Watson and Crick cracked the genetic code, observing at the same time
that DNA codons and the hexagrams of the I'Ching share identical binary structures. Our genetic
code consists of four chemical bases arranged in groups of threes, which is similar in organization
28 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

to the lower and upper trigrams of the hexagrams of the I’Ching. Each of the chemical groupings
relates to an amino acid and forms what is known as a codon. There are 64 codons in our genetic
code, just as there are 64 hexagrams in the I’Ching. The 64 hexagrams around the outer wheel,
translated into the BodyGraph as Gates, can be used in Human Design to thematically understand
or interpret our genetic imprint, and provide very specific detail about the characteristics that make
up each and every one of us.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
HEXAGRAMS (GATES) AND DEGREES

Generally speaking, the inner ring of the Mandala is used for calculation, and the outer for

interpretation. This illustration shows that every hexagram, with its corresponding gate, has a specific

place and measurement of arc in the outer ring. In order to determine its place, we need to understand

again that the 64 hexagrams (each

— with six lines) have a total of 384

lines, while each of the 12 houses of

the zodiac encompasses 30 degrees,
for a total 360 degrees.

6 Lines

3*37'30"

When the 384 line demarcations,
visible around the outer ring, are
measured by or aligned with the
360 degrees of the inner ring, we
can see that each hexagram covers a
space/time of 5 degrees, 37 minutes

4 and 30 seconds of arc. This arc is an
\ imprinting field, a place in space;
when a planet passes through it,

information is exchanged via the
neutrino stream.

When we are born, we are imprinted with the qualities of a specific hexagram for each specific
planet (or Node of the Moon) in the chart. The information carried by the neutrino stream at that
precise moment imprints us in this specific way for the rest of our life. The moment is captured
and instantaneously recorded in our BodyGraph as our definition, our blueprint.

In the illustration above we have an example of the calculation used. When we know the
position of the planet’s location in the inner astrological ring, we can see its correspondence
to the hexagram in the outer ring. The example above has the Sun positioned in the zodiacal
constellation of Aquarius, which aligns it with a corresponding division in the I’Ching wheel in
the 13th hexagram. This information is then transferred into the BodyGraph. We will explore the
BodyGraph in more detail later in this section.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 29

THE HINDU BRAHMAN CHAKRA SYSTEM
THE NINE CENTERS

‘The Hindu Brahman Chakra System is the third component of the synthesis, bringing us to the
nine Centers. One major difference between the traditional chakra system and the nine centers
of the BodyGraph illustrated below is simply that there are seven chakras and nine centers. This
difference reflects the cosmic shift that occurred in 1781 signaling an evolutionary progression
within our species from 7-centered being to 9-centered being.

‘This process involved a complex internal reorganization of the form, not simply an addition of two
more energy centers. Each of the nine centers is an energy hub with its own distinct biological
correlations. (The Centers are discussed in depth in Section Two.)
30 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE KABBALAH - THE TREE OF LIFE
THE 36 CHANNELS AND 64 GATES

‘The Tree of Life from the Zohar/Kabbalistic tradition is the fourth component of the synthesis. It
makes its contribution as the pathways energetically connecting the Centers through the Gates.
‘These pathways, called Channels, create a living circuitry that unifies the BodyGraph and directs the
flow of energy within it (illustration below on left). At either end of each channel, where the channel
opens into a center, you will see a number indicating a particular gate (illustration below on right).
‘The 64 gates correlate to the 64 hexagrams of the outer ring of the Mandala, allowing us to transfer
the information from the hexagrams directly into the BodyGraph.

SOLAR PLEXUS
CENTER

2 GATES

RooT CENTER

Single gates are the way energy enters and exits a center; they are open to meeting the energy at
the other end of the pathway. It takes definition in both gates at opposite ends of the pathway
to complete or define a channel. As individuals we can have both gates defined ourselves, and
thus define the channel, or we can have only one gate defined and meet others who complete the
channel for us.

Asan example, when a person has a gate at one end of a channel they are attracted to a person who has
the gate at the other end of the channel. Their coming together completes or energetically connects
them through the newly completed channel. This third dynamic in their lives is experienced as an
electromagnetic connection. It feels like a spark of attraction. This is one of the many ways in which
we are designed to meet and interact with other people in our life. Basically, the channels connect
the energies of two different centers thus generating something new described as a quantum. Each
channel has its own characteristics and keynote, but remains a flexible or dynamic quantum of
the energy of the 2 gates, 12 lines and 2 centers it brings together. Defined or colored-in channels
become a dominant feature in a person's life and we call this definition your “life force.” This is
discussed in more detail in Part Three of this section, as well as in full detail in Section Six.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE

PART THREE
THE HUMAN DESIGN BODYGRAPH

THE MAP TO NAVIGATE BY

“WHAT MAKES HUMAN DESIGN SO EXTRAORDINARY IS THE BODYGRAPH. THE
BODYGRAPH HAS NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. YES, OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE BEEN
GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF BODIES AND SYSTEMS, BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THE BODYGRAPH IN THE CENTER OF THE MANDALA. THE BODYGRAPH
IS UNIQUE. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS BASED ON AN ENTIRELY NEW NUMERICAL
CONFIGURATION. THIS IS NOT A 7-CENTER CHAKRA SYSTEM. THIS IS A 9-CENTERED
BEING. THE WAY IN WHICH THE INFORMATION IS DRAWN TOGETHER HAS DERIVATIVES
IN OTHER SYSTEMS. THE BODYGRAPH IS THE REAL SYNTHETIC FIELD.” — RA URU HU

Conception marks the moment
when a Design Crystal, along
with its embedded Magnetic
Monopole, enters the ovum
through the process of fertilization.
As the Design Crystal begins
receiving the streaming neutrino
information, it separates from the
Magnetic Monopole and initiates
the building of the fetus. The fetus
will continue to develop until the
end of the second trimester of
pregnancy when the neocortex,
the special brain faculty unique to
humans, is fully formed. At this
point, the Magnetic Monopole
sends out a signal which brings the
Personality Crystal, also called the
soul or psyche, into the body. The
moment of birth, which occurs
approximately three months later,
marks the moment the Personality

Crystal receives its indelible imprint from the neutrino stream. The Birth time is the moment the
baby has left the womb and is separate from its mother’s body, outside the mother’s body, and not
the time when the umbilical cord is cut. Human Design illustrates our uniqueness in precise detail,
and it is very important, therefore, to begin analysis with accurate birth data, especially birth time.
If you are unsure about your birth time, please check with the organization that records births in

your country/state of birth. If you have no way of acquiring an accurate birth time you can hire

astrologer who specializes in what is called “chart rectification.” The astrologer will take you through

a process to determine your birth time as precisely as possible.

an
32 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE BODYGRAPH

Two calculations are needed to generate a BodyGraph. We begin with the date, place and exact time
of each person's birth to establish the Personality or natal calculation. When the birth data is entered
into Maia Mechanics Imaging software, the program automatically calculates a second set of data,
the pre-natal or Design calculation.

‘The natal or Personality calculation (in black column below) is based on the moment of birth,
and the pre-natal or Design calculation (in red column below) is based on a time approximately
88 days (or precisely 88 degrees of the sun) prior to the actual birth. On your own chart you will
see that you have both a Design birth date
and a Personality birth date. Since both
calculations are based on the moment of
your birth, it does not matter whether
you were a full-term baby, premature or
delivered by caesarian section.

‘The two sets of calculations are recorded on
your chart as the Design column (in red)
and the Personality column (in black). The
gate numbers indicate which hexagrams
have been activated, and the symbols
indicate which planet was in the neutrino
stream of that hexagram. The gate numbers
are also recorded in the centers within the
BodyGraph. In the charts on the opposite
YOUR HUMAN DESIGN CHART INCLUDES page that separate the Design from the
YOUR BODYGRAPH AND PLANETARY DATA Personality, you can see where the Design
gates and Personality gates are located; in
the third chart you see how they appear when combined in the BodyGraph. ‘The locations of the
gates in the BodyGraph do not change; they are always in the same place for everyone. What does
change is which specific gates are activated by the planets at the moment of each calculation.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED AND BLACK

‘The Personality and Design can be viewed as separate charts. The red and black sets of information
are both part of your design, but represent aspects that are accessed differently by you. The Personality
information in black is what you have conscious access to; you know these things about yourself
and you can work with this information. This is who you think you are, the ‘you’ with whom you
identify. Having this conscious access is like sitting on a hill overlooking a highway. You can see the
road, the traffic on the road, the direction they are going, and you can wave at the people as they go
by. In other words, you are a fully participating observer. The Design information in red is one of
the most important advances introduced by The Human Design System. It shows you the nature
of your unconscious, what is going on below your level of consciousness. It also represents your
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 33

genetic inheritance, or your bloodline, as a theme from your mother and father and grandparents.
You cannot consciously access the information in red. It is like looking at a tunnel. You have no idea
what is going on inside the tunnel because you can't see the objects or which way they are moving.
‘There is nothing you can do but wait and see what emerges. In other words, what comes out of your
mouth can be as much of a surprise to you as it is to others! Even though with age, experience and
the proper reflection you learn to know the unconscious part of yourself, it is important to remember
that you can never control it. Gates and/or channels colored in with red and black stripes on a chart
indicate that there are multiple planetary activations in that gate or channel in both your Personality and
Design. Those activations function both consciously and unconsciously in your experience of life.

A FORCED MARRIAGE OR
A MYSTICAL UNION

DESIGN

QUANTUM

‘The juxtaposition of your Personality and Design on either side of a BodyGraph, as in the illustration
above, can be revealing. The Personality is who you think you are; the Design is how you are
genetically programmed to move through time in space. These two completely different aspects
merge into the BodyGraph and are held together by the Magnetic Monopole as an integrated
field, a mystical union. It can also be likened to a forced marriage because the two aren't naturally
compatible. The Personality thinks it’s in charge of the life while, in fact, it’s the Design and the
Magnetic Monopole that actually are. Most of the conflicts that arise, and the resistance you meet
in life, stem from the Personality trying to manage your life rather than assuming it’s proper role
which is to sit in the back seat and enjoy the ride.

‘The Personality is not aware of the Design's existence, which is why consciously knowing how to
access your form’s intelligence through your Strategy and Authority is so important, and a major
focus of this book. When the Personality passenger is surrendered to its Strategy and Authority,
the Personality and Design can live in harmony, in union, as they individually perform their
intended roles. This is when you find your path, and when the foundation for all love emerges —
the love of self. Without self-love inside, there is no love for others. With self-love inside, you will
know who is right for you on the outside.
34 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

DEFINITION IN A BODYGRAPH

As the activated gates from both the Design and Personality columns are added (colored in) on the
BodyGraph, channels are formed and centers are defined. Specifically, when the two gates at both
ends of a channel are activated by a planet, they form a defined channel and are colored in on the
Bodygraph. When a channel is defined, the centers at either end are defined or colored in as well.
‘This is called definition in a chart. Definition creates what is called our life-force.

For example, definition is created in this chart when Gates 11 and 56 define the Channel of
Curiosity (11-56), which in turn defines the Ajna and Throat Centers. Your total definition (the
colored-in channels and centers of your chart) shows you what is
consistent throughout your life, what is reliably you. Definition is
always there, every second of every minute of every hour of every
day of every week of every year until the end of your life. It establishes
the characteristics of your life force in precise detail. Definition
establishes your Type, Strategy and Authority and shows you where
you can find your reliable ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when making decisions.

Definition is the core of our being, a potential that we grow into as
we fully inhabit our 9-centered vehicles by living authentically. This is
the self we know deep inside, and the unique (life force) frequency we
project aurically into the world from birth. Our BodyGraph confirms
this, and The Human Design System encourages us to live it.

Definition tells our story. The Science of Differentiation’s complex and
revolutionary perspectives required the creation of a new language to
communicate that story. Ra called it “Keynoting.” Keynotes form a
living, symbolic language, the language of Human Design. They are a
means by which a great deal of information is referenced or compressed
into a single word or phrase. Almost every aspect of the system has its own keynote associated with
it. Like a mantra, keynotes invoke or awaken or connect us with our body’s chemistry, and our own
unique frequency. Learning and using the language of keynotes is like thinking within the body’s
hormonal messaging system; it allows us to connect energetically with others.

By stringing the keynotes of one’s definition and open centers together, professional analysts create
a word picture or story line of a person's character and purpose. Once the keynotes are delivered, the
story penetrates the person beyond the level of the mind. As an example, in the illustration above,
the Ajna Center is connected to the Throat Center via Channel 11-56. This definition tells us that
this person will want to speak his mind and say what he is thinking. Channel 11-56 is called the
Channel of Curiosity, a design of a searcher or a seeker. The 11th gate is the Gate of Ideas, and the
56th gate is the Gate of Stimulation. It is his ideas that he wants to share. With this definition, he
helps make every dinner party he attends a success because he is willing to talk to anybody who will
listen. He enjoys keeping everybody stimulated or engaged in his stories.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 35

Although he has a lot of ideas, and often says he plans to do something with them, he rarely does.
His ideas do not materialize. Knowing this about himself, but not understanding it, is a source of
deep frustration for him. There is, however, a reason why he has this dilemma; his definition stops
at the Throat Center, the center of communication. If the Throat Center were connected to one of
the body’s four motors or energy resources (Heart, Solar Plexus, Sacral and Root Centers, which are
discussed in more detail in Section Two) then this person could turn communication into action.
He could act on his ideas. In truth, this person is not meant to do anything himself with his ideas.
Instead, he is to share them, and perhaps one day to verbally stimulate someone else into bringing
his ideas into reality. Following his Strategy of waiting until he is asked or invited to share his ideas
will increase his chances of success.

DEFINED AND UNDEFINED FORM A BINARY:
NATURE AND NURTURE — OUR SENDERS AND OUR RECEIVERS

“WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ACTIVATIONS IN A CHART, YOU ARE
LOOKING AT THE UNIQUE IMPRINT OF A PERSON. WE HAVE RECEPTORS TO
EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING THAT IS WHITE IN THE DESIGN IS A RECEPTOR.
THE IMPRINT IS WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT; IT ISN’T WHAT MAKES YOU THE
SAME. WHAT MAKES US THE SAME IS THE WHOLE MAP IN ITS ENTIRETY; WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT IS OUR INDIVIDUAL IMPRINT. THIS IS THE SCIENCE OF
DIFFERENTIATION AND HUMAN DESIGN TEACHES US ABOUT OUR UNIQUENESS,
WHAT IT IS TO BE UNIQUELY OURSELVES WITHIN THE TOTALITY.” — RA URU HU

Definition is a fixed and dependable part of us that is to be embraced, expressed and lived. It is
consistent throughout our lifetime and therefore reliable. Definition establishes the parameters for
who we are becoming, the potential we grow into over our lifetime. That which is not defined in our
chart remains white (undefined). These parts are neither empty nor broken. They are a valuable and
fully functioning part of us, but because they operate inconsistently they are simply not a reliable
basis for decision-making. Our openness is our living classroom, and the ultimate source of the
wisdom that we share with others. It is our openness that also determines which challenges or fears
we will face, and what we are here to learn and to discover about ourselves and the world.

Taken together, the defined and undefined portions of our chart form an interactive binary between
what is fixed and what is flexible in our design. This is where nature, or who we are by definition,
and nurture meet. People are inclined to think that definition is superior to lack of definition. This
is not true. It is simply a duality, like day and night.

Our definition is like a transmitter, a message or defining frequency that is sent out into the world
through our aura. What we send out conditions others. Conversely, our undefined centers, gates and
channels are like receivers. Through our openness we experience, reflect (mirror) and magnify the
energies we take in from others. For good or bad, it is through our receivers that we are nurtured by and
learn from our environment. Our openness is also where we are the most vulnerable to conditioning.
Most people have a mixture of defined and undefined centers in their design. Rare exceptions do
occur where a person will have all the centers in their chart either defined or open. We will explore the
defined and undefined centers thoroughly in Section Two.
36 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE SUN, MOON, NODES AND PLANETS IN THE BODYGRAPH

You might call the Sun, Moon, Nodes and planets the local programming agents of our solar
system. The locations of these celestial bodies at the time of our birth determines the way they
influence or ‘flavor’ how we experience our definition. Over the cons, each has taken on specific
mythological and thematic characteristics.

Without the BodyGraph, there is no possible analysis. The database within the BodyGraph is
made up of a total of 26 activations, 13 each from the Design and the Personality positions.
According to the “Voice” no other objects in the heavens, other than the ones listed, can activate
gates. This is not to say that an object, such as Titan, the great Moon of Saturn that is larger than
Mercury, does not have an effect. It filters the neutrino stream, and like everything else adds its
quality, but it does not activate a gate.

Kiron (Chiron), the comet fragment that was discovered in the late 1970's, also does not activate
or ‘open a gate.’ If the thematic presumptions are correct, however, and this object is associated
with healing/wounding, then seeing where it is in the BodyGraph can provide an insight. The
same is true for the astrological ascendant, midheaven, Arabian points, etc., which do not activate
gates either.

Below is a list of the celestial bodies used in Human Design. In addition to flavoring how we
experience our life, they also act as our teachers.

‘The following pages explain the Sun, Moon, Nodes and Planets and their themes, or keynotes. They
also provide a short description of how they are used in The Human Design System.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 37

© Sun — Life Force. The Sun in our chart represents our core energy, our primary yang force. It
is our ‘self’ as well as what we ‘do’ and represents the theme of our incarnation. The Sun represents
the archetype of the Father. (70 percent of the neutrinos that condition us are from the Sun). Our
Personality Sun is how we express our ‘light’ in the world. Our Design Sun represents genetic themes
we have inherited from our Father.

® Earth—Grounding and Balance. The Earth represents where we concretize or bring into form, and
how we ground and balance the Sun's energy within our forms, our bodies. The Sun and Earth always
operate together and are located opposite each other in the Mandala. The Earth provides the primary
yin balance, the archetype of the Mother. We find conscious balance when we are able to integrate the
Personality correctly in our life, and we find our stability (or unconscious balance) when we come to
grips with the world of form. The Earth is the backbone of our stability.

D_ Moon -Driving Force. The Moon represents what moves us, the driving force in our design. The
pull of the Moon is a force that is powerful, always there, and always willing to embody the message
of our Sun's energy. The input comes from the Sun, but the direction or force or drive is represented
by the Moon. The Moon is the archetype of the eldest daughter, and makes possible the task of the
Earth (Mother) to drive and move the form, thus ensuring evolution. The Moon is also the reflected
light that others see in our inner nature brought to the surface and placed on display.

8% North Node of the Moon — Future Direction and Environment. Although not planets, the Nodes
of the Moon are equally powerful. On the Personality side the Nodes are not who you are, but instead
frame what your Personality thinks about the world and itself: On the Design side the Nodes frame your
relationship to the environment and the people in it. The North Node is the mature stage of experiencing
life and shifts from the South Node at our Uranus Opposition (38-43 years). Movement into the North
Node signals a process of letting go of what no longer serves us, and retaining what does.

& South Node of the Moon — Past Direction and Environment. The South Node represents our
developmental stage of experiencing life, our immaturity, until we arrive at our Uranus Opposition. In
our 9-centered Uranian bodies, our transition from the South Node to the North Node symbolizes
mid-life and our entry into adulthood. The Nodes represent the stage on which our lives are played
out, how we perceive the world around us, and the environments that we will experience throughout
our lives that will support us in living out our unique destiny.

¥ ~Mercury— Communication and Thinking. Mercury, the archetype of the eldest son, represents
the expansion of human consciousness, as well as the need within us to communicate. Mercury is
closest to the Sun and thus metaphorically has its ear. Mercury programs the Personality Crystal
from the time it enters the body until birth. Where your Personality Mercury is defined gives you
insight into what you need to communicate in this life. Your Design Mercury also has something
to communicate, but we often do not know why we are telling something to someone when it
expresses through our unconscious form.

2 Venus - Values. Venus establishes our values, and represents our morals and the natural laws
for how we deal with each other and the world around us. Venus is the archetype of the youngest
daughter, and also represents love and beauty. For you personally, Venus is the right and the wrong,
and your moral questions and issues. If you do not act with moral clarity, and if those around you do
not act with moral clarity, Venus can be harsh in her retribution. The values that are established in
Venus become laws in Jupiter, and any retribution takes place through Saturn.

& Mars — Immature Energy. Mars is the archetype of the youngest son, energetically immature
and free of responsibility. Passive until it gets rolling, and then a force to be reckoned with. Once
ignited, Mars’ capacity to build momentum can result in mindless outbursts where even the most
basic inhibitions can be overwhelmed. Mars in your chart represents an extraordinary energy that
when refined over time can settle into a powerful and mature wisdom about the correct use of
energy. Mars plays a significant role in our personal transformation.

A. Jupiter — Law and Protection. Other than the sun, no object exerts greater influence over us.
Jupiter is the logos for the universe and defines our outer development in 11+ year cycles, as well as
our relationship to the other and the whole. We are each imprinted with a very focused theme of
what is correct for us, our law as written by Jupiter. If you live by that law you can gain great good
fortune as Jupiter is very generous at times, but your ability to benefit from the generosity comes
from deep obedience to your own law.

} Saturn — Discipline (The Judge). Saturn is the place in your chart where you must deal with the
consequences of your actions. A very ancient yin force, it represents the judge, and the places in your
life where you will pay for any incorrectness when not following your own laws and morals. Saturn is a
profound signpost that allows you, over time, to see the progress in your process. Saturn is an expectant
task-master without praise. If Saturn is leaving you alone, this is a signpost that you are living correctly;
however, if you break your own rules, values and laws, Saturn will punish you.

‘gl Uranus — Unusualness, Chaos and Order. Where Uranus shows up in your design is where you
express your unusualness. The evolutionary mutative undercurrent of Uranus allowed us to transform
our understanding of the Maia and extend our life span to the current 84 years. Uranus also introduced
us to the tripartite life process of subjective youth, objective mid-life, and transcendent older age.

Y Neptune - Illusion and Spirituality. A great teacher who demands total acceptance. Neptune
in any gate veils its potential. This veiling can deeply disturb the not-self as it is not possible to see
through the veil, and we lose the ability to see any limitations, which can lead to abuse. Surrender to
Neptune, leave it alone, and you allow the potential magic to emerge from behind the veil. You also
learn a great deal about the nature of surrender.

Y Pluto - Truth and Transformation. Pluto brings the forces of the subconscious to the surface;
it represents rebirth. Pluto is the ‘truth teller’, bringing truths that are hidden to the surface for you
to look at directly and squarely in the eye — truth brings transformation. Wherever you see Pluto
in your chart, this is your Truth. Pluto’s deepest lesson is to find the light within the darkness. The
mystery of Pluto, the mystery of you, takes a lifetime to explore.

THE NEUTRINO TRANSIT FIELD

We are all constantly subjected to conditioning forces, either through the chemistry of those around
us, or by the planetary transits from the greater cosmic environment in which we live. In The Human
Design System, the definition is the “student,” the undefined centers are the “school” and the
transiting planets are the “teachers.” The transiting planets inform and affect us directly through
their capacity to filter the neutrino stream.

JOAN’S ENCOUNTER WITH A DAILY TRANSIT

Only the Personality/black calculation is used to create a transit connection chart. Both the red
and black sides of this design are represented by the green activations in the BodyGraph above.
‘The neutrino planetary transit field is shown in blue. We can see where the transit field brings new
activations to Joan for this moment in time, which is how it influences or informs her as it passes
through her. By staying true to her Strategy and Authority, she can stay grounded in her own design,
and avoid being distracted from her course, or by the people around her who have also been effected
by the transit.
40 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

A CONNECTION CHART GRAPHICALLY ILLUSTRATES
THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE

We are also impacted and conditioned by those around us, especially those close to us. The three
charts on the right demonstrate how a connection chart is created. John’s definition is represented
in blue and Mary’s in green. Together they create a quantum field that is greater than either one of
them alone. New channels are defined and open centers are filled in. A great deal can be learned from
the connection chart about how these two people interact with each other, how they unknowingly
influence each other's actions and decisions, and what they project as a couple.

‘The topic of Connections is vast and requires a more thorough exploration than can be provided in this
book. To understand a Connection chart thoroughly, one needs to consider many things including:
Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile, Definition, Gates, Lines, and Centers; and it is recommended that
a Human Design Analyst be consulted. The following provides general information when looking
at relationships through Human Design:

ELECTRO-MAGNETIC: Partners each define one gate (one half) of a channel, thereby defining the
entire channel and creating life force energy together; represents the basic dynamic of a relationship,
attraction and repulsion.

Dominance: One partner defines the entire channel while the other does not activate (define)
either of the channel's gates. The defined channel can only be accepted and surrendered to as a way
to experience the other.

Compromise: One partner defines the whole channel and the other defines only a single gate in
the channel. The partner that only has one gate of the channel activated is always compromised by
the partner with the complete channel.

CompanionsuP: Both partners have the same channel or gate defined in their Bodygraph. This
is the potential for friendship, the shared experience.

‘The synthesis of many systems reflected in your Human Design chart provides you with an
extraordinary new view of your life, and an understanding of the genetic continuity that flows
between the seemingly separate aspects of your design. The combined interplay between your
definition (the true self) and your openness (the not-self) form the foundation for understanding
the ways you will live out your design. Awareness of both who you are designed to be, and where
you are open to taking in the outside world, allows you to have the fullest experience of life, and to
authentically live out your unique purpose as a part of a greater totality.

‘The nine centers are energy hubs that transform or transmute the life force as it flows through the
BodyGraph. The overview on the opposite page will introduce you to each of the nine centers by name,
its distinguishing function(s), and its location within the BodyGraph.

Please note that the Root and the Solar Plexus Centers each appear in two categories. Each of the nine
centers will be covered in more detail later in this section.
HE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 45

ONE MANIFESTATION CENTER: “All roads lead to Rome.” The Throat
Center establishes the context for our discussion of the nine centers. Its extraordinary
and unique function is similar to that of a town square. All energy is being moved
through the other eight centers toward the Throat, where it is given a ‘voice’ as a
means to physically manifest and/or verbally communicate our human intelligence.
‘The Throat Center is how we express precisely what it means to be a differentiated
human being at the top of the food chain.

Two PRESSURE CENTERS: The Head and Root Centers are two pressure
sources that move the energy toward the three Awareness Centers. They are
the pressures to ‘know’ and to ‘do,’ to think and to stay alive. The Head asks the
question which moves the energy on to the Ajna to conceptualize the answer. Root
pressure provides the adrenalized drive to survive, the momentum for moving life
forward. This fuel is a potent energy which is sent on to, and further refined by the
Splenic, Solar Plexus and Sacral Centers, on its way to the Throat where it will be
communicated or acted upon.

THREE AWARENESS CENTERS: The Splenic, Ajna, and Solar Plexus
Centers are three potential areas of self-consciousness and self-awareness. Each
focuses and interprets our life experiences energetically as body, mind or spirit
awareness. (The other six centers function at a mechanical level.) Upon reaching
the Throat, the energy becomes an expression of our conscious intelligence: either
as Splenic intelligence (survival awareness) or as mental intelligence (cognitive

awareness) or as emotional/spirit intelligence (relational/social awareness).

Four Motor (ENERGY) CENTERS: The Root, Solar Plexus, Sacral and Heart
Centers are motors; specific frequencies that provide us with the energy resources
needed to manifest our life. The Root provides us with momentum to keep going. The
emotional wave of the Solar Plexus provides us with the impetus of desire for more
experience, for intimacy in relationships, and for spirit awareness. In the Sacral we have
the generative energy to support the continuation of the Form, the creative life force.
‘The Heart is the motor energy behind the “I, me, mine,” the source of our willpower. It
insures our survival on the material plain through communal hierarchies.

ONE IDENTITY CENTER: lhe G Center is home to the Magnetic Monopole.
Strategically located in the BodyGraph as the center of the Mandala, it establishes
our identity as a direction through time in space called our geometry. This is where
our own unique energy flow or definition connects to the flow of all life — or how
we are wired to the Universe. The Magnetic Monopole pulls our life toward us. We
might say the universe lives life through us.
46 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

DEFINED AND UNDEFINED CENTERS

You will notice in the BodyGraph that some of the centers are colored in, or defined, and some
are not colored in, or undefined. The centers that are defined are fixed and reliable in the way in
which they function and operate. The centers that are undefined (white) are the places in which you
experience outside influences or conditioning. The undefined centers are not broken, they are not
empty, and they do not need to be fixed. They are places where we are vulnerable to conditioning,
and areas to learn and gather wisdom. Each of us are made up of a mix between what is defined and
what is undefned. This is not a question of it being good or bad. The defined parts of us represent
the student living the life, and what is undefined represents where we are going to school — the
school of life. The process of becoming yourself is a process of recognizing where we are taking in
conditioning in life, how it affects us, and how to put it in its proper context. The opportunity for
wisdom lies in this recognition.

UNDEFINED CENTER CONDITIONING AND
THE NOT-SELF MIND

When we transitioned from 7-centered to 9-centeredness in 1781, the strategic (decision-making)
role of the mind shifted from directing our lives to becoming a source of wisdom and outer authority
for others. The mind still insists on doing what it has done for thousands of years — it does not grasp the
fact that its job description has changed, which creates tension between our form and our mind, as well
as between the true self and
the not-self. Our incredible
minds are not capable of being
the personal Authority of our

new 9-centered form.

The Personality Crystal (or
passenger consciousness) is
invited into the fetus during
the last three months of
pregnancy after our body is
fully formed. The passenger
gets acquainted with the
neocortex of its new vehicle,
but has nothing directly to do
with creating any part of the
form or body. Without something specific to do, the passenger decides to take on the job of back-seat
driver, without a license. From its lofty position in the Head Center, it thinks it is best equipped to run
the show, your life.

‘There are two significant details, however, that the passenger mind isn't aware of. The first is that you
already have a driver, your Magnetic Monopole. The second is that your vehicle has recently evolved to
a level of sophistication and consciousness that far exceeds the mind. That is to say, the mind reached
SECTION TWO: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 47

its zenith in the 7-centered being, having guided humanity to an unprecedented level of consciousness
and scientific achievement. However, after 1781, our forms took an evolutionary leap, and our bodies
now have nine functioning centers with a built-in connection to a trustworthy, individualized compass.

‘We each have our own GPS, and it is hard-wired to the universe. Our mind can no longer compete
successfully in decision-making with this new 9-centered form or body that it is joined to, but does
not understand. Undeterred by these facts, the mind continues doing what it has always done — it
tries to direct your life. This does not make our mind an enemy to be overcome, repressed, or ignored,
but rather a creative force that is here to be reckoned with and befriended. Our mind’s designated
role, for which it is perfectly suited, is to think and to dream, to inspire and to formulate, and to
make sense out of life. The mind is an amazing gift when freed from decision-making, and used in
service to humanity. The mind is meant to be a tool for us, and a potential teacher for others. What
stops that from happening is our ignorance about the mechanics of how we are designed to operate.
By making our mind an ally, and liberating it from the task of decision-making so that it can settle
comfortably into its role as a self-reflected conscious observer, we allow our mind to reveal its true
treasures and make its rightful contribution.

From birth, we are continuously in the auric fields of our mother, father, siblings, relatives and others.
Our undefined or open channels, gates, and centers are constantly being defined or energetically filled
in by the definition of others. Over time, we are subtly but deeply influenced by their energy fields —
as well as by their growing expectations of us. This is what The Human Design System describes as
conditioning. Although we never lose touch with who we really are, by the time we have reached seven
years of age, several layers of familial and societal conditioning have been piled over our true selves.

Conditioning cannot be circumvented or escaped, nor is it inherently a bad thing. It is simply
unavoidable. Planetary transits, people, and all life forms, including insects, birds, animals and
plants, connect to us and can influence our thought patterns, our behavior and our decisions,
especially if we are not grounded in our design through our Strategy and Authority. Throughout
our life, the natural curiosity of our open centers attracts us to people with definition in those
centers. Absorbing their frequencies, however, puts pressure on our openness and triggers our
mind into thinking about all we are missing.

‘The open spaces in our chart are referred to as the source of our not-self simply because they are
energetically inconsistent and unreliable. It is when we begin to confuse what we experience through
our openness (that which is not us) with our defined self or true self (that which is consistent
within us) that we run into problems. The Human Design System carefully scrutinizes where we
are open to the impact of conditioning and distinguishes it from our definition. It shows us that, by
following our Strategy and Authority, we are thoroughly and uniquely equipped to face and resolve
the dilemmas arising from our not-self constructs.

Our undefined centers are open to stimulation, and are literally designed to draw us into life. When
we use our mind to make decisions, however, our open centers become part of what is called our
not-self mind. Since that which is reliable and consistent about us is not really interesting to our
busy mind, what is open or undefined becomes a source of deep attraction. It is what we long for,
what we feel drawn to experience, and what we think we have to have or want to be. Unfortunately,
48 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

the seduction of this attraction can lead us away from our core nature, which is why we do not often
live out our own unique potential. The problem is that when we try to be what we are not designed
to be, everything gets distorted; we become lost, caught up in chasing after what constantly eludes
us in our life. Basing decisions on ever-changing and illusive desires — on what is not consistently us
—is like trying to build a house on shifting sand. Eventually, a false assumption begins to grow that
this IS our life. The result is a sense of fatigue and failure, along with frustration, bitterness, anger,
and disappointment with life.

In the early years of your life, your passenger-mind thought its decisions were protecting you and
your vehicle from being overcome, or hurt, by the experiences coming through your open and
vulnerable places. Your mind got caught up in your body's innate fears for its physical, mental and
emotional well-being; its need for security, love and support. Those fears were amplified many times
in your open centers, so your mind developed a hyper-vigilance to your environment. It used how
others responded or reacted to you to keep you compromising your true self, always comparing
yourself to other's expectations and needs of you. It drove you to conform in order to fit in, and to
make life comfortable for you and for those around you. And it worked — for a while. There were
even rewarding trade-offs, but in the end you paid a price.

Each decision we make in life either keeps us on our path or takes us on a confusing and sometimes
painful detour; either moves us closer to or further away from our true nature and purpose. Correct
decisions made from our personal Authority, from that which is defined in us that we can trust, align
us with our destiny, and place us in relationships, locations and jobs that are correct for us. Decisions
made by our mind, and based on conditioning from our undefined centers, cause us to veer from our
course. When this happens we find ourselves confronted by situations we are not equipped to deal
with, making commitments that drain our energy and inhibit the use of our true talents.

Society places a huge emphasis on the mind, or mental awareness, and on making things happen.
‘The conditioning pressure on us isn't going to go away anytime soon. Since we usually have more
undefined spaces than definition in our chart, the vast complexity and amplification of our openness
by the not-self mind easily exerts inordinate power over our lives. It is extremely difficult for our
definition to stand up to the pressure coming through such openness, especially when half of our
definition lies below our level of consciousness. Fortunately, our Strategy and Authority simply by-
pass the illusory net of the mind’s persuasions and allow the driver to drive. This is called surrender,
the state of awareness we seek.

NOT-SELF OPEN CENTER QUESTIONS

‘The open centers in our BodyGraph reveal key vulnerable soft spots, and how our mind has used them
to create its own decision-making strategy in an attempt to keep us from further confusion and pain.
Over time, the mind’s protective strategies become unhealthy habitual behaviors or unconscious habits
that carry over into adulthood. Once you can see where the ineffective habits come from, and that they
come from a space that is not you in the first place, it is much easier to let them go. As we begin to
see just how easy it is to become lost in our openness and then identified with it, we also begin to
see the undefined centers as the rich sources of exploration they are supposed to be. Through them
SECTION TWO: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 49

come our most unexpected encounters, greatest discoveries and deepest insights, all joining together
to become wisdom over time. With the knowledge that The Human Design System gives us about
ourselves, we can begin to appreciate and enjoy our openness in a new way. Wisdom lies in the
unattached experience of our openness. Every one of the undefined centers, channels and gates in
our chart holds the potential for such wisdom.

‘The illustration above lists the not-self mantras for each of the open centers. They are questions that
we can ask ourselves to determine if we are operating from our true self or our not-self. We will
explore each of these centers and their not-self constructs in more depth, however, taking time now
to ask yourself the questions which apply to your open centers can be a most illuminating exercise,
and an effective way to discover how subtle yet pervasive not-self conditioning can be.
50 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE NOT-SELF KEYNOTED IN A BODYGRAPH

Precise analysis of our BodyGraph allows us to literally map how we have been conditioned to think
throughout our life, providing us with amazing details and insights into the workings of our mind.
What we discover is a very strong and powerful link between our mind, early painful experiences
and our undefined centers. The chart example to
the left has been keynoted to illustrate where this
person has been most vulnerable to conditioning
throughout her life. Beginning with the undefined
Splenic Center, which is about security, she has
been conditioned to hold onto things such as jobs,
relationships, places and attitudes in order to feel
safe. The undefined Spleen is concerned about
survival; its easily aroused fears can cause one
to stay in jobs and relationships long after they
have ceased being healthy. Through the undefined
Heart Center, she is conditioned to prove her
worth — that she is good enough, sexy enough,
loyal enough, pretty enough, smart enough and
so on. She is prone to making promises that she
does not have the willpower to keep, but tries
(and fails) to keep them to prove how valuable
she is, ultimately resulting in low self-worth. The
undefined Head Center is a mind that is occupied
with thinking thoughts that don’t matter. Her mind is busily engaged in trying to resolve people’s
unanswered questions. With an undefined Root Center she feels pressure to hurry through things,
and to get things done so she can move on to the next and get rid of the pressure.

‘The keynotes of her undefined centers create a picture of what her mind has been focused on, and
basing her decisions on, most of her life. When we synthesize all this information into a sentence,
we have a person afraid of losing her relationship or job security so she works very hard to get things
done quickly, trying to resolve everyone’s questions in order to prove how valuable she is.

If it is your path to move toward transformation and awareness, you will slowly but surely stop
giving authority to your mind and surrender to the Authority of your form. You will let go of the
mind’s idea of what you should and shouldn't do, and what you think your life is supposed to be
like. Though surrender is not a natural state for the mind, the mind can learn to surrender to your
Strategy and Authority and assume its true position as an aware passenger and observer, having the
ride of its life in a vehicle that knows exactly where to take it.

it is experienced within us, and how it interacts with the environment and people around us.

DEFINED CHANNELS.

DEFINED CENTER: In the illustration above, when two gates at both ends of a channel come
together they form a definition. Gates 7 and 31 form the Channel of The Alpha, defining the G
and the Throat Centers, and Gates 51 and 25 form the Channel of Initiation, defining the Heart
and G Centers. A defined center is a hub of consistent and reliable energy within us. Single gate
activations in a defined center (Gates 33 and 62 in the example) are ‘hanging gates’ that dependably
contribute their theme to the overall definition. Altogether, definition is the energy frequency of our
differentiated self which is communicated to others through our presence.

UNDEFINED CENTER: The undefined or white centers are places of vulnerability where we are open
to opportunities for learning, and to the influence of conditioning forces around us. An undefined center
in a chart has one or more dormant gates. They can be unconscious (red) or conscious (black) aspects
of our design. Dormant gates are alone in the channel; they hang out, waiting to be sparked by an
electromagnetic connection, the gate at the other end of the channel. The dormant gate filters or directs
the incoming energy toward the undefined center(s), making us more aware of its presence within us.

COMPLETELY OPEN CENTER: Though it shares many characteristics with the undefined center, the
phenomenon of a completely open center is quite different. No dormant gates means nothing to hold
onto, no familiar themes or feelings with which to react or connect the energy to ourselves. We can be
most vulnerable in a completely open center because, with no theme to hold onto, the information that is
pouring through the center can be confusing, especially in its amplified state. Fortunately, the converse is
also true. With no dormant gates in place to filter or prejudice incoming energy, we are open to the center's
full potential for experiential learning which becomes a source of wisdom as we mature.

On the pages that follow we will explore each center’s characteristics, how its energy plays out in
your life, and its true selfand not-self themes. Please refer to your Human Design Chart and follow
along to discover the story of you.

THROAT CENTER

be Sie THE WORLD

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

Biologically, the Throat Center is associated with the thyroid and the parathyroid glands. These
are endocrine glands which are responsible for metamorphosis/transformation. The thyroid system
oversees metabolic processes: how we assimilate our food, whether we digest it quickly or not, how
we burn energy, whether we are fast or slow, whether we are big or small, skinny or fat. Resistance
experienced from premature, unwelcome words and actions, or from speaking when we should
be silent, can manifest in our physiology by compromising the health and well-being of our vocal
chords and thyroid function.

MANIFESTATION AS COMMUNICATION AND/OR ACTION

Key physiological changes in the location and structure of the larynx, with a concurrent development
of the neocortex, have shaped the evolution of our species for the past 85,000 years, resulting in our
capacity to express a self-reflected consciousness. These changes made it possible to fully manifest
what it means to be human, both through verbal communication and as deliberate action. Whether
defined in our BodyGraph or not, the Throat Center plays a central role in how we express our self
as well as how we manifest our life vocationally. Even though its function is purely mechanical and
unaware, the Throat Center remains a major focus within the BodyGraph.

If we think of the BodyGraph as the map of a town, the Throat Center would be the town square. As
the central and most complex of the nine centers, all energy flowing through the BodyGraph is under
tremendous pressure to get to the Throat to be communicated or acted upon. The phrase, “All roads
lead to Rome,” sums it up quite nicely. The energy flowing through the BodyGraph is metabolized and
transformed within the body itself through the related biological processes of this center.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 53

‘The Throat Center's primary function is manifestation through communication, expressing who we
are, what we are thinking, feeling, creating or learning, what we know or want to contribute, and what
we have seen or heard and can say to empower others. With its manifesting potential and 11 gates or
voices, the Throat naturally attracts a lot of attention that is designed to set the stage for manifestation.
We are not designed to be alone or isolated from each other. Our ability to communicate effectively
ensures the quality of our relationships, and therefore, our survival. Language and communication
are not about telling others what to do. They are about how to manifest or make ourselves known to
others in unique ways so they can respond to or interact with what we are saying and doing. Through
communicating before acting, we can see beforehand what is viable and what isn't.

Our own voice comes from specific gate activations or channel definition in our BodyGraph. Any
center in our design connected to our Throat Center has a direct outlet through that channel, and this
is where our own consistent and reliable voice (and/or action) comes from. It is so important that our
words and actions count, for they are our truth. What an invaluable gift it is to be able to trust our
Authority for guidance, and our Strategy for the correct timing to manifest it.

With so much pressure on the Throat Center to speak and to do, many people are prone to act or to
say things either too soon or too late. By knowing our voice(s) and what we are here to express or to
do —as well as which gates are open to amplification — we can relax and wait for the proper moment
to engage others in ways that are correct and fulfilling for us. The Golden Rule of the Throat Center
is “Follow your Strategy and Authority and the timing will always be perfect.” This way our words
and actions will be received with their full impact, without resistance and confusion or distortion.

‘The Throat Center's secondary function is manifestation as action. Manifestation is possible when a
motor is connected to the Throat. Those with this kind of definition are true doers who can set things
in motion, and bring to completion what they envision. Of note: Manifesting Generators (defined
from the Sacral motor to the Throat) are the exception as they follow a Generator Strategy of waiting
to respond, not initiating. These distinctions are further elaborated upon in Section Four on Types.

Society, as well as the not-self, places tremendous demands on us to become something, to make a
contribution with our life, such as choosing a job or vocation. The ability to grow into who we are
designed to be, however, is totally dependent on uncovering our authentic self — and living it.

The Throat Center's strategic position in the BodyGraph, and its metamorphic function in the
body, make it a natural place for directing and effecting transformative, mutative change at all
levels of living. The specific frequencies or gates activated in the Throat Center on our chart
indicate just how the changes needed to further our transformation and evolve humanity will be
expressed and moved along through us.

THE DEFINED THROAT CENTER — 72% OF THE POPULATION

Although we assume when we speak that we are expressing the thoughts of our mind, what we
communicate is actually determined by the 11 themes of the gates in the Throat Center. The Throat
is the energy hub for ‘messages’ coming from all parts of the BodyGraph; it transmutes and directs
how that information manifests in the world as communication and action.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY _ 55

Potentially, the Throat can express or act directly from six different centers: the Ajna, Solar Plexus,
Heart, G, Sacral and Spleen. The healthy Throat Center speaks from its reliable source of definition.
For example, a Throat connected to the Heart Center speaks from the ‘T’as in “I want that, I have
that, I will do that.” If the Throat is connected to the Ajna, one speaks what the mind is thinking
and conceptualizing. If the Throat is connected to the Solar Plexus, one speaks or acts on emotions
or feelings. If the Throat is connected to the Spleen, one speaks spontaneously from an intuitive
knowing in the moment. If the Throat is directly connected to the Sacral, one speaks and acts on the
responsive sounds of the Sacral. If the Throat is connected to the G center, one speaks from personal
identity and direction, from the higher self. Therefore, the mark of a defined Throat is the consistent
but limited way it reliably expresses itself.

Those with a Throat Center defined to a motor can always ‘do’ or manifest, but it does not
mean they always should! Having a Throat Center connected to a motor can fuel the urge to be
impulsive, to succumb to the tendency to talk too much or do too much, and to give energy away
to every impulse. When thay confidently and comfortably rely on their Strategy and Authority, and
know where their voice comes from and when to use it, people with defined Throat Centers can
manifest their truth with ease, honesty and clarity.

THE UNDEFINED THROAT CENTER — 28% OF THE POPULATION

‘The not-self theme of the undefined Throat Center is “Trying to attract attention.” People with
undefined Throat Centers are afraid they won't be noticed, so their not-self mind jumps at the
chance to think up ways to attract attention. They can easily succumb to an amplified pressure to
talk, to act, to make an impression, to interrupt or to be the life of the party. They don't realize that
the open Throat naturally attracts attention, and if they wait, invitations to speak will come to them.
In this way, they will receive the proper attention, at the most opportune time, with no need to waste
precious energy doing or saying something to move the process along — as long as their Authority
agrees that they do have something to say that needs to be said. By reducing the urgent pressure they
feel to speak, they reduce stress on their vocal chords.

If the amplified pressure to speak that they experience in their undefined Throat Center has been
conditioned by someone else’s Throat definition, what they say will be unpredictable and probably
poorly received by others. Over time, they can become fearful of opening their mouths. Feeling
out of control and unable to communicate effectively can be most disturbing in our highly verbal
culture. This is remedied by those with open Throat Centers gaining confidence in their Strategy and
Authority to guide their conversations, and learning to understand the way(s) this center functions
at a mechanical level in their design.

When around others with a defined Throat Center, they may feel uncomfortable and end up
doing most of the talking just to relieve the extra pressure. They also spend a lot of mental energy
figuring out what they are going to say next, only to be surprised and perhaps uncomfortable
when they say something completely unexpected. The dilemma is that they cannot plan what they
say with any consistency.
56 - THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The healthiest approach for open Throats is to stop trying to control what they say; they are designed
to speak spontaneously and to enjoy the different voices or forms of expression that come through
them. They understand that they do not need to ‘do’ anything to attract attention. Though they feel
the pressure to speak when they are with others, they are relaxed and comfortable with their natural
state of silence. They know that if they wait, the invitation and proper timing to participate will
present itself. Their wisdom is recognizing who is speaking and acting from their truth — or not.

If not comfortably oriented by their Strategy and Authority, they can become preoccupied with the
questions, “How can I attract attention?” or “What am I going to become in life?” Trying to figure
these out mentally only leads to poorly timed decisions and abortive actions, putting pressure on

their thyroid glands.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN THROAT CENTER

A completely open Throat is most rare as the Throat Center has 11 potential activations. People
with this open configuration have no idea what to say, or what action to take. For example, children
with an undefined Throat Center may take longer to learn to talk, and should be encouraged to
speak at their own pace. When the not-self in either children or adults dictates how and when
to attract attention, talk and act, they will find themselves speaking with a voice ‘borrowed’ or
conditioned by someone else. The result is saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, or being
ignored altogether. The resistance they meet builds over time, affecting both their self-confidence
and their thyroid function.

Once they are comfortable with the flexibility and unpredictability of their speaking, and confident
in their Authority's guidance, the considerable wisdom potential of this center emerges. Among
other things, they will know who articulates well and who is speaking with authenticity from their
own journey.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED THROAT CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self’
mental dialog could sound like with an undefined Throat Center: Where should I go so that I can
get the attention I want? Is anyone noticing me? If I say this then I will be noticed. If] initiate this
conversation then I will get the attention I deserve. I better say something because this silence is
making me uncomfortable. What should I manifest? I better manifest something. What or who will
I become in life?
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 57

HEAD CENTER

MENTAL PRESSURE
INSPIRATION
QUESTIONS, DOUBTS
AND CONFUSION

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

Biologically, the Head Center is associated with our pineal gland which regulates the flow of
information between the gray areas of the brain and the neocortex, or between the Head and the
Ajna Centers. More than 90 percent of mental processes take place deep within the gray areas of the
brain, below our level of conscious awareness, and everything that is processed by our brain is filtered
through accumulated past experience. This creates a pressure that manifests as questions seeking
answers, or the need to know the ‘whys’ of life. It fuels or drives our thinking and conceptualizing,
and how we process the consciousness field.

MENTAL PRESSURE AND INSPIRATION

As above — so below. At the top of the BodyGraph is the Head Center with its mental pressure,
understood as inspiration. At the bottom is the Root Center with its adrenalized pressure, understood
as stress. The Head Center functions as the pressure to comprehend, to think, and to make sense of
things in the world. It’s pressure moves our thoughts toward conceptualization in the Ajna Center
by pushing our questions toward formulas and opinions, our pondering toward clarification and
insight, and our confusion toward realization and ideas — and then on to the Throat Center where
they are transformed into language. Human Design refers to this pressure as inspiration, the ways
we have of taking in information from the cosmic field of consciousness.

‘The inspiration of the Head Center is not a motorized energy that leads to action, but rather a
pressure that drives our mental activity. It stimulates our imagination, our unique mode of thinking
(Head) and conceptualizing (Ajna), and initiates our everyday, mundane thoughts as well as our
most lofty and probing questions about the mysteries of existence. Quite simply, this is the pressure
to ask questions, and expect answers, that we experience throughout our day.
58 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Our Head Center pressures or directs mental activity to the Ajna along three channels that represent
three time frames. It formulates questions focused on securing our future (Gate 63); it takes in and
processes what is new and worth pondering in the moment (Gate 61); and it begins sorting through
the sometimes confusing muddle of past experience to find its meaning (Gate 64). This routing is
crucial to setting the three sources of inspiration in motion, and decoding them so that they arrive at
the Throat with their maximum potential to impact and communicate still intact. This questioning
curiosity of the intellect, the mind’s extraordinary gift to penetrate the unknowable, to make sense
of life and to be an inspiration for others, is here to be enjoyed as a source of never-ending wonder.

Each decision that liberates our mind from running our life, releases and refocuses the mind’s
tremendous creativity so it can make its essential contribution to the understanding, the evolution,
and the quality of life on the planet. Unfortunately, when the not-self usurps the role of our personal
Authority, the Head Center begins a stream of meaningless questions and thoughts about things
that truly do not matter. This can become an incessant pressure to know that fills us with doubt and
confusion, driving us further away from ourselves. If the pressure builds without release, it can result
in severe headaches like migraines. Another consequence of letting our not-self distract the Head
Center from its proper role is that we keep our mind from reaching its potential in our life as the
true source of wisdom that it actually can be. It is from the Head Center that we learn about the
nature of inspiration, how to experience the pressure without losing sight of the wonder, and how to
recognize what/who is truly inspiring or not.

THE GATES OF THE HEAD CENTER

‘There are only three gates in the Head Center. The nature of the pressure and the theme of each gate
establish its parameters and mode of inspiration. Pressure from the Head Center moves inspiration
toward the Ajna for conceptualization and then on to the Throat to be communicated. The pressures
described below nag at us until we let them go or find a way to resolve them.

Gate 64 - Before Completion Abstract pressure to make sense of the past, and to

THE DEFINED HEAD CENTER - 30% OF THE POPULATION

Definition between the Head and Ajna Centers creates a consistent mental pressure to ask and to
answer the question, and to grasp and to understand things, including consciousness itself. Dealing
with the persistent pressure of inspiration is often difficult and can heighten mental anxiety, as
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 59

inspiration is always about what has not yet been grasped — it merely frames the question. Those
with defined Head Centers have a fixed way of thinking. The themes of their particular gates and
channels become the subject or source of inspiration available to others. When they are part of
a group, their auras put people with undefined Head Centers under pressure to think. Only 30
percent of the world’s population has a defined Head Center, but they are capable of inspiring (or
pressuring) the remaining 70 percent who do not.

‘The Head and Ajna Centers are not connected to one of the four motors, therefore, there is no energy
for them to bring their thoughts and ideas directly into manifestation. Struggling to do so only leads
to frustration, anger, bitterness or disappointment. By waiting for the opportune moment to motivate
people with their stimulating questions and possibilities, such as people who can put the ideas to
work, those with a defined Head and Ajna eliminate the resistance they meet when they impose
their ideas on a world not yet prepared to act on them. That is to say, relying on their Strategy to
determine the timing and receptivity of their audience will save them valuable energy, reduce anxiety,
and increase their self-confidence. It is natural for those with defined Head and Ajna Centers to feel
under continual pressure to resolve their thought process, to understand their own inspiration, and
answer their own questions. If, however, they succumb to impatience with this persistently unresolved
state, and turn the mental pressure inward on themselves, they can experience deep anxiety, self-doubt
and depression. If they attempt to relieve the pressure by turning it outward into action, the result is
usually a hasty, incorrect decision, and a missed opportunity to be a true inspiration. The challenge is
to accept the mental pressure without trying to act on it or escape it. Confusion, doubt, and clarity
are natural processes that have their own inner timing and resolution. Under the guidance of one’s
Authority, they become qualities which stimulate thought-provoking questions, and a wide array of
answers capable of uplifting, inspiring and empowering others.

THE UNDEFINED HEAD CENTER - 70% OF THE POPULATION

Those with an undefined Head Center have no consistent way of deliberating mental information.
If normal inspiration becomes an amplified pressure to think about things that don’t matter, they
can get lost in their own mental monologue. Meaningless not-self thoughts and questions will
ultimately steer them away from correct decision-making processes. As anxiety increases, they
may seek to assuage it by looking for someone or something inspiring to focus on. Undefined
Head Centers tend to either avoid intellectual pursuits, or throw themselves into one mystery after
another. They are easily caught up with trying to make decisions and solve problems that are not
even their own, becoming lost or overwhelmed by doubt and confusion which actually belongs to
someone else. Pressure to resolve other people’s questions as soon as possible weighs them down,
making it difficult to empty all the ‘stuff’ out of their heads so they can relax, which puts even more
pressure on their minds to try and figure things out, to answer their unending questions. Since they
can't solve their problems with the same not-self mind that created them, the key to emerging out of
this swirl of confusion and doubt is to bypass the mentally busy undefined Head Center by relying
on their Authority to guide them. The secret to maintaining mental health is to refuse to act out
of mental pressure by remaining a detached observer of their thoughts, and letting their Authority
direct them to appropriate ways of using their minds.
60 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The real potential of the undefined Head Center is to wonder and explore the mystery of life, human
consciousness, and the intellectual possibilities of an infinite range of subjects. It can discern which
inspiration is worthy of contemplation and how much of the mental field is simply a distraction —
who is inspiring and who is confusing. People with open Head Centers can use the information that
they take in from others to become great reflectors of what other's are thinking, and help discern
the value of these thoughts for humanity. They are open to new insights, and love to be filled with
inspiration and ideas from all directions. They enjoy the pressure to know more without becoming
identified with or overwhelmed by it. When experiencing confusion or doubt, they let go of the
compulsive need to resolve it because they know it will pass. Ultimately, they can be open to the
beauty and depth of the unknown, and enjoy both the question and the confusion while trusting
that things will become clear, or not; whichever is correct for them.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN HEAD CENTER

‘Those without gate activations in the Head Center have no innate way of recognizing when one thing
is more inspiring or interesting than any other. There is no consistent means of connecting mental
pressure to the rest of their design, or to naturally ease them into a familiar way of thinking about
things or entering into dialogue with another person. They don’t know what to focus on, especially
in this overwhelming age of information. They simply don't know what to think about, what matters
or doesn't matter, or why, and often fear thinking about anything at all. Such anxiety can lead to
disconnecting from their intellect and avoiding conversations that are intellectually stimulating. Or,
they can become easily distracted by the pressure to think up answers, or give away their Authority
by relying on others to tell them what is interesting, inspiring or important. In order to enjoy their
healthy and boundless capacity for wisdom, and to understand the pressure behind the question and
discern what is inspiring, completely open Head Centers need to allow the often amplified mental
pressure they experience to pass through without identifying with any part of it. As they become
comfortable with themselves over time, they become sensitive to the nuances of the Head Center
and its true gifts, and can gauge who uses their minds effectively, and who does not. They may even
be sensitive enough to ascertain what others are thinking. In this way, deep explorations into all that
their mind can inspire will fill them with wonder.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED HEAD CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say
or do. Noticing this not-self talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what
the not-self mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Head Center: I need to find
something inspiring. Maybe if I go there I'll find something inspiring. I need to find an answer to
my questions. Where can I go to find the answers? Who has the answers? I've got to understand
this and/or make sense of this. Where can I go or whom can I talk to in order to find the answers?
Is this supposed to be interesting? What should I be thinking about?

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

Biologically, the Root Center is associated with the adrenal system and the production of stress
hormones. Stress, as understood in the context of this center, is merely a fuel. It energizes certain
biochemical processes deep within us that are designed to help us master the situations we meet in
life, and sustain our momentum to progress and evolve. Stress cannot be avoided, nor can we fight
against this vital fuel without paying the consequences. If we do not understand the mechanics of
this pressure on our body, we can easily push ourselves too hard. If we turn this pressure inward, we
can become depressed and sufter deeply. One by-product of maintaining a healthy balance between
too much and too little stress is a sense of vitality that spills over as joy for living.

ADRENAL PRESSURE (FUEL) AND MOTOR ENERGY

Both the Head and Root Centers are sources of pressure, or fuel, which drive energy towards the
Throat for communication or manifestation. This similarity gives these two centers a deep and
inherent connection to each other. While the Head Center brings mental pressure in the form of
doubt, confusion, and inspiration, the Root Center brings the pressure and fuel to evolve, to adapt
to the world, and to get us through our most difficult challenges. It provides us with our purest and
most powerful energy and momentum to keep life moving forward.

Unlike the Head Center, however, the Root Center is unique in that it is both a pressure center
and a motor. Nine different life processes are fueled by energy that originates in the Root Center.
‘They ultimately make their way to the Throat Center, but only after this powerful fuel that moves
them along is processed or tempered by passing through the centers around it: the Sacral, Spleen,
or Solar Plexus. The Root’s pressurized or adrenalized energy is far too strong to be directly
connected to and manifested by the Throat Center.

Root pressure literally gets the body moving, and is an essential ingredient of manifestation in our
lives. How we direct the stress, which by itself is neither good nor bad, is determined by our own
unique Root Center configuration (the specific gates that are defined or undefined).

THE DEFINED ROOT CENTER — 60% OF THE POPULATION

A defined Root Center has a fixed and particular way of dealing with stress, and the pressure to
move ahead in the world. The Root can be defined to three different centers: the Sacral, Spleen,

and Solar Plexus.
SECTION TWo: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 63

‘The three connections or channels between the Root Center

and the Sacral Center (in the illustration to the left) are called

\ Format Energies. They dictate whether the way we operate in
the world is logical and focused, cyclical and developmental,
: or unpredictable and mutative. Those with the logical format
ny \ energy (the Channel of Concentration 52-9) live life in a step-
acces by-step logical, detailed and organized way; those with the
a abstract format energy (the Channel of Maturation 53-42)
Sah live life in multiple experiential cycles with distinct beginnings,
Ona \ middles and ends; and those with the individual format energy
\ (the Channel of Mutation 60-3) live life with on and off power
rs »*" \ bursts of mutating energy. These Format Energies powerfully
a permeate the entire design of those that have them, and have a
significant influence on people that come in contact with them.

In order to stay healthy and thrive in the material world, those

who have the Root Center defined to the Splenic Center are
able to rely on their fixed way of dealing with the pressure to survive, move up, and correct what isn’t
working. In this way, the Root fuels existential awareness and survival consciousness, including the
joy of being alive in a body.

One who has the Root Center defined to the Solar Plexus Center will have a fixed way of dealing
with emotional stress, with what is new and desirous, and with personal and social relationships.
‘This is pressure fueling emotional awareness or emotional/relational intelligence.

It is possible for people with defined Root Centers to also succumb to not-self stress. If the powerful
pressure they feel all the time is not properly guided by their Strategy and Authority, they can
become obsessive. They go about their life initiating, and thus meet resistance in the form of the
wrong kind of stress which is detrimental to their health. Their tendency is to project this pressure
or stress onto others in the form of unreasonable expectations.

Once they are comfortable with their own consistent internal pressure, they can be alert to times
when people with an undefined Root Center are allowing unhealthy levels of magnified Root
pressure to drive them. As long as they begin something out of their Strategy and Authority, and a
place of stillness and joy, then no matter how challenging or stress-filled their endeavors, they will
remain grounded in their Root Center's sustaining energy.

THE UNDEFINED ROOT CENTER — 40% OF THE POPULATION

‘The undefined Root Center absorbs stress from its environment. People with an undefined Root are
subject to pressures from those with a defined Root. Because the amplified pressure is uncomfortable,
they are always trying to get rid of it, yet as soon as they do another pressure takes its place. They
rush around and accomplish the work of three people, trying to resolve pressure that cannot be
resolved. It’s an endless, unsustainable cycle that eventually results in burn out.
64 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Undefined Roots take in and amplify the adrenalized Root Center stress in the world, but are not
equipped to sustain that level of momentum for long. Over time, this kind of conditioning can become
hyperactivity, uncontrollable restlessness and an inability to focus. Children often pay the biggest price.
When the amplification of energy from others through their open Root Center is misunderstood
as misbehavior or uncooperativeness or mental deficiency, they are usually punished, humiliated, or
referred to therapists. Think about all the children with open Root Centers who have been given drugs
to calm them down. Understanding the overall mechanics of a child’s design makes it possible to
explore new ways of working with these energy dynamics, without damaging our children.

Most people operate without awareness and allow outside pressures to drive them. When adults or
children with undefined Root Centers begin to understand that the pressure they feel is not their
own, they can find ways to avoid being overwhelmed by it. Basically, there are two things they can do
when experiencing stress. One is to step away and avoid it while taking deep breaths to release some
of the pent-up pressure, and the other is to take advantage of the adrenalized energy. For example, an
on-stage performer with an undefined Root Center can be empowered by the adrenaline rush from
an enthusiastic audience. The opposite reaction to a huge shot of external adrenaline is paralyzing
fear or stage fright. Living off the adrenalized pressure can become a habit, or an addiction, leaving
one vulnerable to all sorts of health issues and accidents.

When operating correctly, undefined Root Centers wait for their Authority to guide their decisions.
‘They do not judge themselves to be lazy or incompetent if they fail to work quickly, or simply
refuse to. They can distinguish between healthy and unhealthy environmental pressure and are not
addicted to either — they simply recognize them for what they are. They know when to use the
pressure correctly to increase their productivity, and when not to. They give themselves the time
needed to actually enjoy completing a task once it has been properly committed to.

‘The wisdom to be gained from the undefined Root Center comes when they no longer identify
with or are lost to the habits of their conditioning. At that point they are able to observe how
stress functions, and to discern how to use it properly. They know when it is healthy to take
advantage of the adrenalized pressure and when to avoid it. The key is to recognize what pressure
belongs to them and what does not.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN ROOT CENTER

‘Those with completely open Root Centers can experience the full range of its pressure, from the deep
stillness of focused concentration to intense hyperactivity, but they don’t understand it. When they
are not paying attention to their Authority, they tend to operate unconsciously, allowing amplified
adrenal pressure and incorrect mental decisions to push them through life. They automatically
answer the phone, say yes, speed up, become accident prone, and hurry through things so they can
be free of the pressure, all the while believing this is the way to live. Because they neither understand
nor recognize the pressure, or the fact that it is amplified and not their own, they don't know how
to use it productively. Their system cannot sustain that level of amplified pressure or momentum for
long and will eventually collapse in on itself. Examples would be extreme cases of stage fright, or
panic attacks where they cannot move forward at all in the moment, or move on with their life. They
can lose their joy of being alive.
SECTION TWo: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 65

Nature is a place of peace for them, a respite and peaceful buffer zone from the stressors of the
demanding, fast-paced world we live in. Once they have let the pressure that is not their own pass
through them, and their system is quieted, they can re-connect with a comfortable and livable level
of pressure within themselves. By using their Strategy and Authority, they maintain a healthy and
productive balance between the pressure that moves life forward, and the pressure to be still. Peace,
patience and balance are then possible, along with the wisdom to clearly see and evaluate the nature
and effects of this fundamental yet often overwhelming stress on individuals and humanity.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED ROOT CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self
mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Root Center: What am I going to do to make
my life better? Where is my purpose? I have to achieve something in my life. I better hurry up and
get this done. I have to start something new now. How can I get past this limitation? What am I
going to focus on? I need something to focus on. I need to be needed. Who needs me? Where can I
go to be needed? Where is my passion? What am I passionate about? I feel like a new experience. I
have to hurry up and initiate a new experience. I don't want to waste any time. I have to get this done.

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

‘Three biological functions are associated with the Ajna Center: the neocortex, the visual cortex and
the pituitary glands. The tiny anterior and posterior pituitary glands, located at the base of the brain,
act as our body’s maintenance headquarters. They send hormonal messages to the thyroid glands
with instructions that keep us alive, on track and functioning optimally. These master glands of the
endocrine system are intimately connected to all parts of our body, and it is not surprising that for
eons we have lived a mind-dominated life. Although the pituitaries still oversee our entire system,
the body’s overall level of conscious awareness has evolved, and the role of the mind has shifted.

MENTAL AWARENESS, THE MIND AND DECISION MAKING

Ofthe nine centersin our BodyGraph, three are Awareness Centers: the Spleen (Body Consciousness),
with its body and survival intelligence, the Ajna (Mind Consciousness), with its mental intelligence,
and the Solar Plexus (Spirit Consciousness), with its emotional intelligence and emerging spirit
awareness. It is through these awareness centers that we become conscious of our experience of
being alive, and in relationship with others. The other six centers are purely mechanical, operating
below our conscious level of awareness.

‘The Head and Ajna Centers function together as the mind. The Ajna Center is a processing hub
for transforming pressure, that arrives as inspiration from the Head Center, into useful information
for review, research, and communication. The Ajna is merely an interpreter; like the Head, it cannot
manifest. The Ajna, flanked by the motor-less Head and Throat Centers, is the only awareness center
in the BodyGraph locked away from energy. The other two awareness centers do have access to motors;
they can act out of their awareness. The Splenic Center is next to the Sacral and Root Centers, and
the Solar Plexus, a motor itself, is next to the Root, Sacral, and Heart Centers. Mental awareness,
which was the second awareness to evolve (Splenic awareness was the first), dominates the way we
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 67

perceive our world today. Our perceptions are derived from two major processes: one is visual and one
is acoustic. The visual, associated with development of the visual cortex, is concerned with what has
been and what might be. The acoustic is associated with pure inspiration and the pressure to know now.

‘The awareness frequency of the Ajna Center is different from that of the Splenic Center. Splenic
awareness is existential, spontaneous, in the moment. The frequency of our mental process operates
over all time. A decision made mentally has a long shelf life and can be mulled over until death! This
means that any decision we make based on what is coming out of our openness will be lived over
and over for the rest of our life. We will remain stuck in its illusory web. For example, if you make a
decision from your not-self mind and it doesn't work, your mind will automatically suggest that you
try another option. If that doesn't work, it will say you should have used yet another option. None of
these options are correct for you, and none of them will work, ever. You have simply become trapped
in a web of ineffectual suggestions and dead ends. Recognizing that the mind has no authority in
your life is the only way to extricate yourself from confusion and disappointment, and from making
incorrect mental decisions.

‘The mind measures or processes information in a dualistic ‘this or that’ manner — a valuable asset
for simultaneously weighing two or more sides of any concept. The Ajna can look at the positives
and the negatives of a decision, and construct two arguments that are opposite to each other. One
argument says the option is bad ‘because,’ while the other says it’s good ‘because. This is all the mind
can do, however; it argues back and forth. It can neither judge nor know which is best. It simply
determines how many sides of any issue there are to consider.

Imagine that you have had a misunderstanding with someone and you want to straighten it out. You
want to talk to the person about it and get it off your chest. You can use your mind’s analytical gifts
to come up with lists on both sides of the argument, but don't call the person yet! Let your Strategy
and Authority guide you as to when you are to speak and what you are to say, otherwise, you will
replay that conversation over and over again. “Did I do the right thing? What if I had done it this
way or said it that way?” Pain and regret, rather than resolution, are the consequences of poorly-
timed reactions, simply because the dualistic mind cannot let go of the other side of any issue. We
cannot know our own truth from this place of mental rationalization and comparison. Our truth
must come from our personal Authority.

Awareness is the end result of successfully dealing with fear, and each awareness center has its
own forms of fear to confront. The fear experienced by the Ajna Center is expressed as mental
anxiety fed by the fear of not knowing something, or the fear of being misunderstood. Both fears
are healthy when they drive us to better understand our ideas and communicate them clearly. When
communication fails, however, the anxiety comes to the surface. How we deal with the anxiety will
either lead to our mastery and awareness, or to a further heightening of the anxiety. Whether our
Ajna is defined or undefined, we all carry these fears. They are magnified in the undefined Ajna.

‘The value of awareness, or mental intelligence, does not come from being in control, but rather from
our ability to share and empower others with our unique perspective, at the right time and in the right
place. We are here to encounter each other; to articulate our experience of being human; to enrich,
educate, and store history for future generations; and to contemplate and explore life’s possibilities.
68 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Each gate in the Ajna Center carries a form of mental anxiety that alerts us to the possibility
that we are succumbing to external expectations which thwart our awareness, and put our mental
health in jeopardy.

THE DEFINED AJNA CENTER — 47% OF THE POPULATION

‘Those with defined Ajna Centers conceptualize the same way most of the time, resulting in consistent,
specific, and trustworthy mental functions. Their mental preferences and predispositions are determined
by their gates/channels, and they are not easily influenced by another's presence. They can conceptualize,
inspire and pressure others to think. Their minds are used for processing data, creativity, and as an outer
authority for others. In these ways, they condition the mental field and people in their aura.

Defined centers are always ‘on,’ and those with defined Ajna Centers are always thinking, always
processing. They may find it difficult to meditate because they can’t stop or control their mental
activity. On the other hand, they enjoy their mental stimulation. The Ajna can be defined to
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 69

either the Head or the Throat Center. If their definition is between the Ajna and Throat, they can
always speak their mind according to their strategy and authority. Either definition can create a
head-strong tendency to make decisions from the mind, which often leads to feeling inadequate
or hypocritical if one can’t follow through on what was said. When defined Ajna’s become over-
reliant on their minds, they tend to waste a lot of energy obsessing about an uncompleted action
or decision that is too late to do anything about.

THE UNDEFINED AJNA CENTER — 53% OF THE POPULATION

If the Ajna Center is undefined in a chart, the Head Center will also be undefined. Gate activations
in either undefined center provide themes for the ways our mental activity connects us to people
with whom we interact.

Open Head and Ajna centers can have an open and flexible mind. This is a sign of the mental
intelligence indicative of thinkers or intellectuals like Freud, Jung, Einstein or Madame Curie. Once
a person's mind is set free from conditioning, it is open to a full range of intellectual stimulation
and creativity. Innate and learned wisdom about the intricate workings of the mind can come to
the surface. When they do not hold onto, or lay claim to, concepts, ideas or opinions as their own
personal truth, or become overly identified with any one of them, these open minds are able to
deeply contemplate and discover the world through their intellectual gifts.

‘Those with undefined Ajnas are able to discern which concepts have value, and to recognize who is
capable of providing an answer to the question(s) under consideration. They have the capacity to sift
through the myriad of possibilities and gather what matters. They often pick up thoughts and ideas
before someone in the group speaks them aloud.

As a child, they might grow up feeling that their ideas, which seem to come from nowhere or
everywhere, are irrelevant or wrong. Fear and conditioning lead them to believe they need to be
certain about their ideas in order to appear intelligent. Fearful of looking stupid, they pretend to be
certain about things that don’t matter. As this can become a habit over time, they may do it without
even knowing it.

Imagine a child with an undefined Ajna Center being taught by someone with a defined Ajna
Center. A parent, for example, putting pressure on a child to think logically when the child is
designed to think abstractly. The child feels pressure to think in one particular way, and when he
or she cannot do this consistently, begins to feel inadequate. Such children will grow up feeling
something is wrong with them, and through conditioning will compensate by pretending to be
certain about things in order to feel accepted and acceptable.

Once they realize and have accepted that their mind operates in an inconsistent way, however, and
that they can never really be certain about anything, their mind becomes a playground. It reverts to
its correct role as a classroom, a delightful source of entertainment, and a treasure trove of wisdom
for others.
70 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE COMPLETELY OPEN AJNA CENTER

‘Those with a completely open Ajna Center and a completely open Head Center can have difficulty
knowing what to think or how to interpret or conceptualize what they do think, which is so
important in terms of fitting in to our mind-oriented culture. With no gate activations, or guiding
channel through which to organize their thoughts, they have nothing fixed and reliable to depend
on. This can leave them with a sense of helplessness, anxiety and even futility about the benefits of
thinking at all. If their not-self takes advantage of this situation by strengthening its arguments for
running their life, it will lead to the abdication of their personal authority.

‘Those with a completely open Ajna Center can derive great pleasure in contemplating a wide
variety of theories, concepts and insights — without becoming attached to any of them, or to any
particular way of thinking about them. They learn to recognize a good thought or concept which,
when stimulated by a proper invitation, may be able to move to the next level. One of their most
practical contributions is helping us see through the ways the not-self and not-self mind seduce us
away from our true path and purpose.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED AJNA CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self
mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Ajna Center: I better figure this out; we have
to figure this out. What should I do with my life? I've got to figure out what to do with my life.
Where is my next move? I am certain that (fill in the blank). I have to figure out life because it
feels futile. I have to ‘know’ the answer. I have to put order to my life to get rid of the chaos. I have to
make this new idea a reality in my life. ] better not share this because people are going to think I'm
weird or strange. I’m not going to share my opinion because I don’t want to be challenged. I have to
be ready for the challenge. What am I going to say?

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

‘The Splenic Center is associated with our lymphatic system, the spleen and T-cells. The cells of
the lymphatic system act like little ears, noses, and tongues all over the body. Ever alert, they are
constantly listening, tasting, and smelling to make sure everything in our environment is healthy and
in balance. If something isn’t, they warn us. This is the hub of our immune system. When T-cells
(splenic soldiers which make up about one fifth of our body’s cells) are called into action, they attack
and destroy anything that invades the body. Their job is to protect us from disease.

Children with undefined Splenic Centers are probably the first to come home with any illness out
there, like the flu, a cold, measles or mumps. It is their body's way of slowly building up a natural
immunity to common diseases. The key to maintaining the health of these children is to allow them
to heal completely after they are sick. Give them a few more days off from school to regain their full
vigor. Teach them how to take care of themselves in order to strengthen their potential well-being.
As adults, they will be sensitive to their health and to how they feel, learning about what food and
health remedies work for them and what to avoid. Typically, they need gentler health remedies than
those with a defined Splenic Center.

‘Those with a defined Splenic Center tend to take their health for granted, and benefit from regular
checkups to make sure their hard-working Spleen isn’t concealing potential problems. When they
do succumb to illness, they usually require a lengthy recuperation time. It is imperative that they
heal completely before returning to a full, active schedule.

AWARENESS AS FEAR FOR OUR SURVIVAL

This amazing center, with its primal fears for our survival and well-being, is also a source of our
light-heartedness and laughter, our spontaneity and daring. Its existential awareness, its awareness
72 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

in the now moment, keeps us moving safely forward, while deep inside it steadily cleanses built-up
toxins and the adverse effects of negative vibrations/memories from our system. (In review: of the
nine centers in the BodyGraph, only three are described as awareness centers — the Splenic, Ajna
and Solar Plexus. Awareness is what allows us to be conscious of our experience of life. The other six
centers function on a purely mechanical basis.)

Awareness has evolved over millions of years, and each of the three awareness centers represents
a different phase in that evolutionary process. The Splenic Center is the oldest. Its survival-driven
primary awareness connects us with all life forms — plants, reptiles, birds, insects, and our closest
relatives, mammals (see designs below). As the oldest awareness center, and the center most common
to all life, its essential function has always been to keep the form alive — literally keeping it from
becoming someone's or something’s lunch.

‘The work of this center is instantaneous, instinctual alertness for anything that threatens our well-
being, including negative emotional vibrations. Fear is its mode of operating as fear for survival
generates alertness. Over time, these primal fears evolved into a form of intelligence, a type of body
awareness or body consciousness focused on what is needed to survive, adapt, and thrive in the
mundane world. This intelligence remains alert and on guard within us to this day.

Of the three awareness centers, the Ajna (unique to human beings) is twice as strong as the Splenic,
and the Solar Plexus (not yet fully evolved as an awareness center) is twice as strong as the Ajna. The
fact that the Splenic Center, with its responsibility for life-and-death, is the weakest of the three
indicates how fragile life is. The not-self voices of both the Ajna and the Solar Plexus Centers can
easily override the quiet little alerts coming from our Splenic awareness.

All awareness begins with fear, and each of the three awareness centers has its own fear frequency.
Each gate in the Spleen represents a primary fear for survival. The Splenic system's awareness is an
aspect of our intelligence that is created each time we face and survive a fear-filled challenge to our
existence, our confidence, and our well-being.

THE DEFINED SPLENIC CENTER — 55% OF THE POPULATION

‘The Splenic Center is responsible for our surviving and thriving with a sense of well-being in the
world. It manages our instinct, intuition and taste which are processes for discerning what is or isn't
healthy for our survival. Its non-verbal recognition operates in the present moment, in the ‘now.’ This
vital, spontaneous information is what we call intuition, gut instinct or a hunch; it allows us to make
74 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

trustworthy spontaneous judgments/decisions. Moment-to-moment awareness, however, means that
the Spleen never repeats its first alarm. If we do not pay close attention to those little alerts immediately,
we will miss their warning which is always rooted in what is needed for survival right now.

‘Those with a defined Spleen Center as their Authority must listen to their intuition, do what it tells
them to do, and not let their not-self or anyone else’s mind distract them from following their own
instincts, which are trustworthy and produce reliable results. They then remain alert and protected,
feel good, and can enjoy the benefits of a strong immune system. They can project a state of well
being that is envied by those with undefined Splenic Centers who do not consistently feel good.
Living fully in the present moment with a care-free but prudent abandon is the by-product of a deep
attunement with existence. It requires an ever-growing dependence on their vehicle’s awareness, their
body’s intelligence, to guide them and protect them throughout their life, second by second by second.

‘The mind is not an authority, even though its loud, reasoned thinking can easily overwhelm the
Spleen’s subtle messaging system. When a person receives a sudden warning, there is no time and
no way to figure out why the Splenic Center sent the message. Existential awareness cannot be
rationalized; it must simply be trusted. Understanding the fuller perspective of an experience can
only happen by looking back after the fact. And what is not correct for a person one moment,
may be correct 30 minutes or a day later. For the Spleen, the present moment is all that matters,
all it is aware of.

After years of letting the mind override the intuitive knowing and awareness of the Splenic Center,
people can end up completely out of touch with their instincts, put their life at risk, and suffer
unnecessary ill-health and unhappiness. They ‘think’ they dare not follow their body’s intuitive
intelligence, yet it can be disastrous for them not to.

UNDEFINED SPLENIC CENTER — 45% OF THE POPULATION

Seven primal fears reside in the Splenic Center, and when the center is undefined, these fears are
easily magnified. Those with undefined Spleens need to face each of their fears, one by one, in order to
become fearless in a healthy way. This is how they develop awareness, and honor and learn from their
fear rather than suppress it or pretend it’s not there. Confronting and handling the fear makes them
stronger and less frightened each time the fear returns. The result is a sense of well-being. If they are
unable to do this, however, the conditioned not-self may become overwhelmed by the fears.

‘Those who are born with an undefined Splenic Center enter the world with a fundamental fear
that they are not equipped to survive here on Earth. They are also open and sensitive to the lack
of well-being in the world and interpret this personally. When people in their environment with
defined Spleens condition them, they feel better and safer. They grow up unconsciously seeking and
clinging to people with defined Spleens for the security and sense of well-being it seems to provide
— regardless of what else comes with it. They typically end up holding on to what is not good for
them, and this can lead to all sorts of unhealthy dependencies, especially in familial relationships,
such as children with an undefined Spleen who have a Splenically defined parent. Even if the parent
SECTION TWO: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 75

is abusive, these children will do everything they can to hold on to the parent simply to access the
conditioning ‘feel good’ frequency of the defined Splenic Center. They will be terrified if sent to
their room alone, and often feel rejected, abandoned and fearful that they cannot survive. This causes
them to cling to the security of the parent even more, eventually creating an unhealthy dependency.
Because of this early conditioning, the not-self minds of these children will convince them to hold
on to what is not good for them as they mature.

At the adult level, those with an undefined Spleen who are in a relationship with a defined Spleen
that is no longer healthy for them, will say things like: “It will be better tomorrow” or “Maybe the
therapy will work” or “What about the children?” This is the dilemma for many battered women
who go back to abusive spouses. The deep fears of survival, the attraction to be with a defined Spleen,
can blind them to who is good for them and who isn't, or to when to hold on to a relationship and
when to let go.

When an undefined Spleen is temporarily defined by a defined Spleen or passing transit connection,
it can experience a deceptive sense of security. The mantra for someone with an undefined Splenic
Center is ‘never make a spontaneous decision.’ Being spontaneous, except in potentially harmful or
threatening situations, poses a risk to the undefined Spleen because it cannot trust the ever-changing
impulse of the moment. The not-self of the undefined Spleen is attracted to spontaneity in an effort to
feel good and make the fear disappear, but it usually comes with a high price.

When undefined Spleens are in the aura of a defined Spleen, they are naturally under pressure to be
spontaneous. In most cases they are unaware this is happening, but what they end up doing is living
the life of the person pressuring them. It is not their life, however, and it may not be safe for them.
If they follow their Strategy and the guidance of their Authority, they avoid the temptation to be
impulsive. Impulsive decisions made in the moment from a conditioned undefined Splenic Center
may cause them to let go of beneficial things as well. “Oh, I don’t need that (or them) anymore.”
Once the conditioning is broken, however, they realize they made a mistake and let go of something
that really was good for them. Sudden decisions made without relying on one’s consistent Authority
can have long-term consequences.

People with a healthy orientation to their undefined Spleen can discern the difference between
what is their own need to attend to, in terms of some aspect of their health, and what is a lack
of well-being coming from the environment. When they are with unhealthy or deeply unhappy
people and find themselves feeling ill, they understand that they are probably absorbing the other
person’s ill health or unhealthy vibrations. They can sense when someone or something is not
good for them. They can be tuned into their instinctual and intuitive awareness, yet know this is
not the authority for their decisions. They pay close attention to their health and nurture their
body’s resilience. They understand how important it is to face their fears, and how to deal with the
fear of survival. They develop the wisdom to know how intuition works, who has it and who does
not. Ultimately they can become highly intuitive themselves. Their undefined Spleen is never a
reliable resource for making decisions, however, because it is very vulnerable to the conditioning
in their environment. By entering into new relationships through their Strategy and Authority,
they get the correct Splenic conditioning in their lives.
76 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The wisdom that comes over time through the undefined Splenic Center allows many professional
healers to bring great benefit to their patients. When they step into their client’s aura, there is a
spontaneous recognition, a sense of whether the person is healthy or ill, and what might be out of
balance. Such intuitive empathy emerges as the undefined Spleen learns to distinguish between
what it is filtering through from others, and what energies are its own. Intuitive awareness or wisdom
about someone else is available to the undefined Spleen only when it does not identify with what
the other person is experiencing.

COMPLETELY OPEN SPLENIC CENTER

‘There is a healthy and natural level of fear in all of us. When children or adults with a completely
open Splenic Center lose contact with the fears that keep them alive and healthy, they can become
insecure and fearful of everything. They do not know what to be afraid of, and can also become
fearless to the point that they do foolish, risky and unhealthy things.

‘The same wisdom of the undefined Spleen, described above, is enhanced by their complete openness
to the full range of instinctual and intuitive intelligence vibrating through this center. This awareness
includes the ways laws, values, and our entrepreneurial endeavors nurture, protect and ensure the
survival of our offspring, thus promoting the growth of a healthy society.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED SPLENIC CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self
mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Splenic Center: Let’s not do that because it
makes me insecure or because I’m afraid or I feel fearful every time I think about doing it. Let’s not
say that because it might upset that person. I’m afraid that I will feel inadequate if I do that. I'm
not going to do that because I might fail. I’m afraid of doing that because I’m afraid of what the
outcome will be or what the future will bring, or I’m afraid of the responsibility or the criticism. I
cant do that because I might lose my connection with that person. They might leave.

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

‘The Solar Plexus Center is associated with the lungs, kidneys, pancreas, prostate gland, and the
nervous system. Its themes are feelings, emotions and sensitivity, and its function is to allow us to
gain a sense of emotional clarity and well-being. When a person's emotions run unconstrained over
time, the physical well-being of several major organ systems is directly affected. Water retention and
weight gain are common examples of the consequences of unresolved emotional stressors.

‘The Solar Plexus provides the potent energy driving the cyclic nature of human experience; its
desire frequency is continually moving us toward encounters with pleasure and its opposite, pain.
It is the center of revolution, poetry, romance, compassion, spirituality and religion. We seek to
prolong its highs to stay connected to spirit, and we do everything in our power to avoid its lows,
our unfilled expectations and sense of separation. With half of humanity acting impulsively from
these emotional ups and downs, and the other half avoiding dealing with emotions altogether, we
find ourselves living in an emotionally distorted world.

‘These distortions permeate every aspect of life on this planet. No other center in our time has a
deeper impact on humanity, individually or globally, than the Solar Plexus Center. Comprehending
the mechanics and chemistry of this center can release years of painful emotional patterns, re-
establish physical health, open the way for renewed pleasure with living, and engender a wholesome
compassion toward ourselves and others.

EMOTIONAL AWARENESS AND FUTURE SPIRIT CONSCIOUSNESS

Each of the three awareness centers has a unique frequency. The Splenic Center governs the
immune system and operates in the now, spontaneously and existentially. The Ajna Center governs
mental awareness and operates over all time. The Solar Plexus Center, which is both a motor and
an awareness center, governs emotions and operates on a biochemical, oscillating wave over time.
78 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The Solar Plexus began a mutative process several thousand years ago, sometime between the birth
of Buddha and the birth of Jesus, moving us toward a new kind of awareness referred to as spirit
awareness. The process will be culminated when it is cosmically supported beginning in 2027. Spirit
consciousness is the opposite of differentiation; it is about oneness, and experiencing ourselves as a
single entity. Such consciousness results when the emotional waves between two or more beings are
in resonance. As a highly differentiated, interregnum species, we cannot even imagine how it will
feel to share such consciousness so deeply with others. This developing awareness lies beneath the
surface of our present emotional system.

As 9-centered beings we are just beginning to explore, and to discover experientially, the breadth
and depth and comprehensive implications of this Solar Plexus mutation that we are all a part of.
What we do know is that when we bypass the mind’s conditioning, and live our differentiation and
our own truth, understanding, accepting, and loving who we are, we free spirit consciousness to
mature on the planet, and to move the mutation toward its future fulfillment.

THE FREQUENCIES OF THE EMOTIONAL WAVE

THE EMOTIONAL WAVES

SOURCE OF ALL WAVE MECHANICS

TRIBAL: NEED

THE CHANNEL OF OPENNESS (22-12)
THE CHANNEL OF EMOTING (39-55)

COLLECTIVE: DESIRE
THE CHANNEL OF RECOGNITION (41-30)
THE CHANNEL OF TRANSITORINESS (36-35)

‘The defined Solar Plexus Center releases a wave pattern that takes us from one end of the emotional
spectrum to the other. It is a chemistry that we experience as feelings, needs and desires. Each
cyclical wave goes from hope to pain, expectation to disappointment, joy to despair — and back
again. To create emotional stability in our lives and throughout the world, we must understand,
accept, and eventually transcend this wave pattern, none of which is achieved by mind control. The
SECTION TWo: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY _ 79

key to transcending the emotional system, and the potential waves it sends into the environment, is
‘waiting.’ As we wait through the ups and downs, our understanding is deepened, the wave begins to
level out, and clarity eventually arrives. Understanding this continual wave movement, and waiting
for clarity, can stop one who is emotionally defined from sending out reactive, premature, chaotic or
harmful emotions into the environment.

THE SOURCE OF ALL WAVE MECHANICS (Channel 59-6) operates out of the 6th Gate as this is
where the emotional wave is created, and then reaches across to meet the fertile sacral power of the
59th Gate. It is here that need, passion and desire are created in order to break down barriers, and
penetrate and bond us together in the dance of intimacy. This emotional wave feels very stable and
takes another person to bring it to the surface.

‘The three emotional waves are categorized by their frequency. A person may experience a singular
frequency, or a combination, depending on the definition.

THE TRIBAL WavE (Channels 19-49 and 37-40) operates through physical touch and sensitivity
to needs. This wave ratchets up until it explodes and then resets itself to start the process all over
again. Let's take an example of a man whose wife is doing something that bothers him. He doesn't
tell her how he feels about it so it continues for weeks. Each time she does it, his emotional wave
ratchets up a notch until one day it explodes. The wife had no warning, didn't see it coming and is
taken by surprise. The emotional outburst could be hard on her, but once he releases his built-up
emotions, he is back to normal; all is fine. When both partners understand the mechanics of this
Tribal wave — how to anticipate the explosion, how to sort out the real issues, and how differently
the outburst affects each of them — they will reach new levels of comfort and understanding in their
relationship. For instance, a gradual build-up of emotional tension, mixed with a desire for intimacy,
can be quietly and effectively released by a sensitively-placed hand on the shoulder at the end of a
long, hard day. No words are necessary for the Tribe; its all in the touch.

THE INDIVIDUAL Wave (Channels 39-55 and 22-12) operates through the expression of
moodiness, emotions, melancholy or passion (but only when in the mood). It moves along on an
even keel most of the time, with smaller, shorter, up and down spikes. Knowing when to be alone
and when to be social makes all the difference, and those with this wave might feel melancholic for
a short time until they are moved to a new place along their wave and their mood shifts. Emotional
tension in their relationships, when they are down in their wave, is eased by knowing when to take
time to be alone with their creative muse.

THE ABsTRACT WAVE (Channels 36-35 and 41-30) operates through desire and feeling, and
moves from peaks to valleys. Based on expectation, this wave crashes when the desire or expectation
is not met. The trick to transcending this wave is to enter into something just for the experience,
without placing any expectations on the outcome. For example, a woman imagines herself in love
after a few dates. She fantasizes about how great the man is and how wonderful their future will be,
only to discover he does not live up to her expectations or share her feelings. Repeated spikes and
crashes like these can be tough to handle, and may become personally destabilizing over time if she
has no awareness of the mechanics of the emotional wave.
80. THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘What is most important to understand about the emotional wave is that it is simply an inescapable
chemical process that keeps the wave constantly in motion. No explanations accompany its shifts
and swings. Unfortunately, without this awareness, those who are emotionally defined attempt to
rationalize their emotions, and to explain or make up a reason why they are up or down on their
wave. When they feel sad, their friends want to know why and what they can do to make them
happy. It can become more important to them to put the blame somewhere, rather than to embrace
and accept the depth and beauty of the chemistry itself. Blaming something or someone for what
is pure emotional chemistry can be a source of great confusion when all they need to know is that,
as the wave moves to another place they will feel different. There is no need for a reason for where
they are now on the wave, or where they will be tomorrow. They are simply always moving with it.

Generally speaking, whether we are emotionally defined, or undefined and taking in the
conditioning waves of others, we have to be careful not to identify with the wave or its movement
as if it were us. Remain the objective observer; we are not the wave but we are being taken to our
depths by it. Both the highs and lows of the wave can be beautiful when we don't let either of them
disturb our inner tranquility, the tranquility of knowing what is ‘normal for us. Society perpetuates
the notion that we should be happy all the time. Because of this, most emotionally defined people
live their lives fighting against the down side of their wave, convinced that something is wrong
with them. True liberation comes when they learn to observe, accept and embrace the full gamut
and gifts of their wave.

AWARENESS AND NERVOUSNESS

‘The fears that accompany the Solar Plexus Center's present state of emerging awareness, are
experienced as nervousness based on emotional uncertainty. One never knows for certain how
to feel about something or someone, or what feeling to base a decision on. Because of the social/
relational nature of the Solar Plexus, with its broad movement from hope to pain, this nervousness
can be powerful and pervasive. As people are moved forward along the wave, nervousness is either
amplified or disappears; is there or not there. Emotional uncertainty can distort the way we view
things, making mountains out of molehills.

‘The vague or haunting nervousness that arises from living with uncertainty is a form of fear that
needs to be confronted in order to be overcome. When those with a defined Solar Plexus Center
go through their wave, accessing the depth of their truth and waiting for clarity, they are able to
either confirm or dispel the uncertainties and suspicions underlying their nervousness. By properly
identifying and effectively confronting their uncertainty, they can move beyond their emotional
fears (nervousness), and transcends them over time. In this way, fears become emotional intelligence.

Each awareness center engenders a particular form of fear. In the Solar Plexus, fear manifests
as nervousness about engaging others, as the constantly moving biochemical wave leaves it
emotionally uncertain. Each gate description on the opposite page reveals how fear as nervous
uncertainty is experienced.

THE DEFINED SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER — 53% OF THE POPULATION

THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ‘NOW.’ TRUTH REVEALS ITSELF OVER TIME.

For those with a defined Solar Plexus Center, this is their place of personal Authority, and it operates
as awareness over time. They are designed to wait through the ups and downs of the emotional wave
before making decisions. It is not easy for them to be patient. The Solar Plexus is an immature
emotional center driven by a motor, and it houses a lot of energy. Their task is to learn how to
patiently harness the potential benefits of this energy as they flow with it. Their tendency is to jump
in when they are high on their wave and jump out when they are low. In both circumstances, they are
emotionally impulsive rather than emotionally clear. Clarity is only available after waiting out the
emotional wave. At a minimum, those with a defined Solar Plexus Center need to sleep on things
before making an important decision.

When the Solar Plexus is defined, the feelings these people have about ‘this’ or ‘that’ become an
authoritative guide. These feelings are indicators of what is correct for them or not. “Does it feel
good to do that? How do you feel about it?” These are important questions they need to be asked.
It is essential for them to take time to fully experience their range of feelings without being rushed.
Emotional clarity is reached when there is no longer an emotional charge attached to the decision.
Making decisions from still waters is easier said than done. When people are excited they tend to
jump, only to regret it after they reach emotional clarity. Patiently waiting for clarity will protect the
defined Solar Plexus Center from making spontaneous decisions that may result in poor choices.

As people move through their wave, it helps to understand that the emotional cycle is a dynamic,
chemical process, and that hope and pain are not end points of awareness. Awareness comes as
clarity at the end of the emotional wave’s cycle. Knowing what is correct takes time, and there are
no short cuts. In addition, emotional clarity is not a certainty. The Splenic Center gives an absolute
answer in the moment, while the constantly moving Solar Plexus wave samples the present moment
as one of many points along the way. In the end, there is no guarantee that 100 percent emotional
clarity is possible because the wave keeps moving. There will come a time, however, when emotional
calmness is reached and a deeper truth is recognized about the decision to be made.

Solar Plexus energy is juicy, seductive, and powerful, which gives those with emotional Authority an
advantage if they wait out their wave. It is kind of like playing hard to get. The longer others wait, the
more they will want the Solar Plexus’ warmth and energy. In a business negotiation, waiting until they
are clear rather than consummating a quick deal, gives them the upper hand. If the other backs out
before the defined Solar Plexus reaches clarity, the deal probably wasn't correct for them to begin with.

‘There is a complex interaction between those who are emotionally defined and those who are open.
‘Those with definition are responsible for the emotional environment as a whole because they color
it with their waves. They impact others merely by how they feel inside, by the pure mechanics of
their chemistry and how it is transmitted through their aura. When those with definition feel good
or bad, those with undefined emotional centers will feel VERY good or VERY bad as they amplify

the frequency. In other words, the undefined center reflects back to those with defined centers just
SECTION TWo: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 83

how they are feeling, or where they are in their emotional process. It’s interesting to note that people
with emotional definition, being so familiar with it, don't always notice their emotionality, whereas
those who are undefined are conditioned to think that they are the moody, emotional ones instead.

‘The attraction between an undefined and a defined Solar Plexus is both common and strong among
couples. Despite the warmth and strong attraction of this center, those with a defined Solar Plexus
need to take their time when entering into a new relationship. It’s only over time that they will know
if someone is right for them or not. When they learn to know someone through their wave, they
will know them deeply. They will see how their emotions impact the other person, how that person
handles the highs and lows of their emotional wave. Manipulative and passive-aggressive behaviors
can surface in relationships between defined and undefined emotional systems, and it takes time for
these patterns to reveal themselves. Long courtships are not only advisable — they are essential to
the success of the relationship.

‘The advantage of having emotional definition is the depth that can be cultivated on any topic. As one
moves through the wave, its many perspectives can bring great insight. For example, a photographer
who wants to understand the nature of a flower. The Splenically-oriented photographer would take
one picture capturing an exquisite moment, but for those with a defined Solar Plexus, one picture
would never be enough. They would take a series of pictures all day long, changing the light, the
perspective, the camera. They would know how the flower looks in the morning and how it looks when
the sun sets. They would know its fragrance, how it feels to the touch, and how it looks bending in the
wind. When the emotional system is given the time it needs to unfold, it becomes an intelligence with
deep sensitivity that grasps things at the ever-changing emotional level, the level of spirit.

When those with a defined Solar Plexus Center do not wait out their wave, they tend to be impulsive,
jumping in and out of experiences and decisions on the high or low end of their emotional wave,
thereby creating chaos and confusion. They put others in their environment under pressure to make
immediate emotional decisions with them. When they are upset, they blow up rather than wait for
a moment of calm from which to act or speak, only to regret later what they said or did. They do not
recognize the importance of being alone when down in their wave.

Waiting through their wave allows emotionally healthy people to be in touch with how they are
feeling as they move along their wave. Without being impulsive or spontaneous, they take their
time and ride out their emotions until they feel a sense of clarity before making a decision. They
understand how their emotions affect others and do not place pressure on them by being pushy.
‘They know how to take advantage of the seductive side of their emotional definition by using their
need “to wait” to reach carefully considered agreements that satisfy the desires of all involved.

THE UNDEFINED SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER — 47% OF THE POPULATION

‘The undefined Solar Plexus Center absorbs and amplifies the emotions present in its environment.
This center carries an especially deep conditioning potential, and can be particularly vulnerable
to the needs, moods, and feelings of other people. It is critical for the health and well-being of
the emotionally undefined to know when the emotions they are feeling and expressing are not
84 ee THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

entirely theirs, and that they can release them and protect themselves by not identifying with them.
Otherwise, they bounce up and down on the emotional waves of others, knowing their emotions
are out of control but interpreting that as something wrong within themselves. They repeatedly
make emotional decisions which leave them regretful and plagued by shame or blame, a burden the
undefined Solar Plexus is not genetically designed to handle.

Open centers are like open windows. The Solar Plexus is designed to take in and sample the
emotional field, but only for informational purposes. It is not healthy to identify with or personalize
that field, or it becomes theirs, and they do not have a reliable built-in way to deal with it. They lose
their transparency, their ability to merely reflect an emotion back to its owner.

‘Those with an undefined Solar Plexus may feel as though they have been emotionally out of control
all their lives. When emotionally confronted, they may experience sensations that include fear,
terror, shock, and anger. They may bounce from happiness to depression, personalizing emotions and
feelings as if they were their own when, in fact, they are simply taking in, amplifying, and distorting
the emotions of those around them, They may suffer from being punished and rejected by others
who perceive them as emotionally unstable. They often feel something is wrong with them. They
are generally so sensitive to the emotional climate that they have personalized emotionally charged
events over the years, hanging on to and taking the blame for what does not belong to them.

Children who are open emotionally take in and personalize their family’s emotional ups and downs,
amplifying and often ‘acting out’ their confusion. Thinking that they are personally responsible
for making the waves, they decide at an early age that it is better to lie about or hide the truth
of themselves deep inside rather than suffer a parent’s emotional outburst. When the situation is
reversed, and the parent is open emotionally and the child defined, the parent can lose control and
become over-reactive while amplifying the emotions of the child. Understanding these dynamics
can help us raise healthy, stable, independent children — and enjoy parenting.

Confrontation makes emotionally undefined people nervous. As they mature, they develop not-self
strategies to avoid emotional backlash by steering clear of confronting others for fear of rocking the
boat or upsetting someone. They develop a persona that says, “I won't upset you if you won't upset
me.” They attempt to sidestep any potential confrontation that might follow if they dare to express
their own truth or needs. Though those with open Solar Plexus Centers will never enjoy dealing
with emotional confrontation, their Strategy and Authority will guide them to confrontations which
are correct for them to face.

It is often just the thought of confrontation that keeps those with an open Solar Plexus frozen in
terror. The actual confrontation may be much easier than imagined when they stand in their own
Authority, and the results may end up being the best thing that could happen because it is correct.
If confrontations are always avoided, life is lived on a superficial level. It helps to remember that
on the other side of pain is pleasure, and on the other side of fear is the freedom to be ourselves.
Confrontation when handled correctly, when we simply speak our own truth rather than blaming
someone else, is a catalyst for healthy transformation.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 85

Access to the full spectrum of this center's great pleasures, such as sexual energy, food, passion,
excitement, romance and music, is available to those with defined or undefined Solar Plexus Centers.
For emotions to be a beautiful experience for the undefined center, however, they cannot identify
with them. Awareness of the emotional wave allows them to let go of patterns and emotions that
never belonged to them, which in itself can bring tremendous relief. When they understand why
emotions have been so difficult, they can begin to properly realign their lives to their own personal
Authority. They are able to discern who is or is not emotionally healthy for them, and when it
is appropriate to confront others with their truth or needs, or to walk away. They discern which
emotional fears are theirs to deal with and which are not, and do not make emotional decisions.
‘They realize the emotions they take in and feel in an amplified state are from others, and do not
attach to them.

A healthy undefined Solar Plexus Center is a barometer of the emotional health of others; it can be
a good objective observer of the emotional climate. Its wisdom takes the form of discerning who is
making progress toward emotional health, stability and spirit awareness. On its own, it can remain
emotionally cool, and allows those with undefined Solar Plexus’to rely on their Strategy. When they
suddenly feel uncomfortable emotionally, they know they can leave the room, and the conditioning
auras of others, until the coolness returns. It is a good practice for them to enjoy some time alone
every day in order to release the emotional conditioning they have taken in.

COMPLETELY OPEN SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER

Although many characteristics of the undefined Solar Plexus Center also apply, the completely open
Solar Plexus differs in that it does not have any way of filtering or connecting to incoming potent,
emotional energy. Those with a completely open center can be confused by what they are feeling, and
don't know how to interpret it. They don’t know what to desire, when to be sensitive or passionate, or
how to recognize and deal with people's needs or moods. They often feel something is wrong with
them emotionally. The potential wisdom is to know and understand the emotional waves in their
purest state without anything coloring or prejudicing them.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say
or do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-
self mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Solar Plexus Center: I don’t want to go
there because I don't want to deal with the confrontation. Let’s go here because there won't be any
confrontation to deal with. Let’s not say that because it might upset that person. Let’s say it like this
to soften the potential confrontation. Let’s be really nice and smile a lot so they like me. There is no
point in going there because I might be disappointed or be rejected. It’s not worth it. I'm afraid it
wont work out so why bother. I’m afraid to tell her the truth because I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

no HEART CENTER

WILLPOWER
EGO AND
\ THE MATERIAL WORLD

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

‘The small size and unobtrusive position of the Heart Center in the BodyGraph is deceiving, as it has
a significant physiological impact on our life. Its four gates are associated with the stomach (Gate
40), the thymus gland (Gate 26), the heart (Gate 21) and the gall bladder (Gate 51). Those who
are unaware of how this center operates are more vulnerable to diseases of the heart and digestive
system. And when the heart stops, everything stops!

WILLPOWER AND SELF ESTEEM

The Heart Center is a powerful motor that drives willpower and ego power, enormously influential
forces in the world. The bedrock of society is rooted in the will — the will to survive in community
and thrive on the material plane. The Heart Center has a direct connection to the Throat Center,
and therefore speaks and acts for the tribe. From the beginning, it has been the Tribe that provided
the support system that ensured the survival of the family, community and nations. It established the
foundations for our communal and entrepreneurial ways of life. Community organization created
a safe, interdependent environment, that made it possible for people to specialize, take their unique
skills to great heights, and progress as groups or as individuals. Our great civilizations could not have
been built without the Tribe’s supportive, hierarchical structures held in place by the four gates of
the Heart Center.

‘These gates determine the different ways members of the Tribe connect to one another in order
to successfully live out what is called the material way. These gates are about making our daily
bread, bonding and living in harmony with others, bringing children into the world, and creating
infrastructures like societies, cultures and religions, to nurture and support what we create.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY - 87

At the present time the Tribe is undergoing stressful, structural change that challenges its
entrepreneurial and communal foundation; changes which call into question the authority and
stability of our most fundamental traditions and institutions. The fear engendered by these changes
magnifies the pressure on those with open Heart Centers to prove their worth in order to survive
the uncertainty. Issues of self-esteem and self-worth surface and affect every level of our life, from
relationships, to our work, to what we believe, to giving ourselves permission to play and enjoy this
incredible life we have been given.

‘The bottom line is that self esteem is a place from which we move into the world with confidence
as a valued and contributing member of society — and receive material and personal support in
return. Without this firm belief and trust in ourselves and our own value, we lose our will to meet
the challenges of life. Unless the ego is affirmed in its healthy state, and reassured of its value
by our self or others, it shuts down and self-esteem becomes self-loathing. Self-hatred exacts a
terrible price from humanity.

In this context, it becomes clear why so many heart and digestive problems are related to the ways
in which the not-self compensates for poor self-esteem. The tendency toward over-achievement,
making promises or bargains that we don't have the will power to keep, and laboring beyond what
our heart muscle is able to support in order to prove our worth, are all symptoms of trying to prove
our worthiness. Understanding the mind’s role in determining how we ultimately value our self, or
not, can eliminate a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering in our life.

THE DEFINED HEART CENTER — 37% OF THE POPULATION

If you have a defined Heart Center, you like to be in control of your own life and your resources.
‘That includes what you wear, when and where you work, and which demands on your time you will
respond to. You also recognize your own value, although at times you may tend to inflate it.
88 _THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

It is healthy for those with a defined Heart Center to exercise their willpower, to make and keep
promises with regularity. With consistent access to their willpower, they have no problem making
and keeping their promises or resolutions. It is important that they do what they say they are going
to do. Since this is how others develop a level of trust in them, they should only make promises they
can and will keep. In this way, they strengthen their natural sense of self-esteem.

‘They enjoy working, though they prefer to be in a position where they can be their own boss.
In this way they can follow their natural internal mechanism which tells them when to work
and when it is time to rest. They enjoy successfully delivering the goods, and being willful and
competitive comes naturally to them. When they listen carefully to their inner guidance, they
will know when their great ego strength can best be brought to bear on a situation, and still
maintain a balance between work and rest.

‘Those with a defined Heart Center should not allow anyone to deny them an honest and clear
expression of their ego and will power. Their assertive ‘I, me, mine’ statements strengthen the heart,
whereas suppressing their natural ego energy can be detrimental to their health. They are proving
themselves all of the time, which is both important and correct for them, and they will do it naturally
as long as they follow their Strategy and Authority. They willingly commit their willpower to provide
for the family and the community when it is right for them to do so. Even though they enjoy their
work, they like to be appreciated and rewarded for their contribution.

With a defined Heart Center, it is easy to get carried away and come across as too forceful. When
not guided by their Strategy and personal Authority, they can place unrealistic expectations on those
with an undefined Heart Center to be competitive and willful as well. They can attempt to pump
others up, or push them to perform beyond their capacity, which eventually leads to unnecessary
pain and misunderstanding. Eventually, these behaviors will meet with resistance, indicating that it
is time to step back and regain a healthy inner balance of power.

THE UNDEFINED HEART CENTER — 63% OF THE POPULATION

People with undefined Heart Centers are not designed to be willful and competitive, yet they
often feel driven by a need to find the courage to exercise their will. “Why can’t I get what they
have?” they ask. “Why can’t I be as fast or as good as they are? I should be able to compete with
them.” While they want to exercise willpower, and to make and keep promises, they do not
understand that they have no consistent energy to support either one.

We live in a world that sends a constant stream of messages that we should/could/can be better,
prettier, richer, faster, and more successful if only we would do this or that. This propaganda
puts tremendous pressure on us to make more, do more and be more. People with an undefined
Heart Center get trapped in a vicious cycle. If they fail to live up to expectations, or to fulfill their
commitments and promises, they make further promises to make up for their sense of self-deficiency,
only to fail again. Each time they fail, they feel worse and their self-esteem spirals down further.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 89

Over-achieving is one way the undefined Heart Center compensates for its seeming lack of will, for
a sense that it doesn't have what it takes. When a person undervalues themselves to begin with, they
will attempt to accomplish more than anybody else in order to prove how valuable they are. They
‘will themselves into impossible situations, trying to do something they can't possibly complete.

An undefined Heart Center is susceptible to amplification by a defined Heart Center's will power,
and can deceive itself into thinking it suddenly has the will to make and keep a commitment.
‘This ‘borrowed’ willpower evaporates, however, as soon as the person with Heart Center definition
leaves. This is frequently the case during motivational workshops, where one supposedly leaves with
enough direction and enthusiasm to follow through and accomplish the goal, only to watch the
good intentions and the will power fade away when on one’s own again.

The challenge for those with an undefined Heart Center is that they generally do not consider
themselves worthy and will accept less of everything, including love, money and happiness, because
they assume they do not deserve it. If they rely on their minds, rather than Strategy and Authority,
they will be proving themselves forever. The more the mind gets into the game of trying to prove value
or worthiness, the more one is going to fail, and the cycle of self-deprecation will continue to repeat itself:
‘The solution is to relieve the mind of its assumed authority and return the authority to where it belongs.

‘The mantra for an undefined Heart Center is: never make a promise to yourself or others. The open
Heart has NOTHING to prove to anyone, under any circumstance, ever. It is such a gift not to
have to prove one’s worth. Imagine 63 percent of all people at peace with themselves, knowing that
they will be guided to commitments which are correct for them by their personal Authority, not by
a need to appear worthy.

With this realization comes wisdom and awareness. A person without Heart Center definition can
take in the vibration of other egos, becoming wise about who has a healthy sense of self-esteem and
who does not. They recognize who can or cannot deliver on a commitment. They learn that they do
not have to compete with anyone, and they do not let anyone convince them to do or to commit to
anything merely to demonstrate their worth.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN HEART CENTER

People with completely open Heart Centers do not naturally have a good, solid grasp of what
worthiness is, how to measure it, or what one needs to do to achieve it. When not living within
their realm of personal Authority, they are prone to wavering between feeling an exaggerated sense
of importance and of having no worth at all. With fragile or inconsistent self-esteem, and a nagging
sense of inadequacy, they are particularly vulnerable to being manipulated and controlled by people
who promise to convey worthiness on them by association, or by believing this or that propaganda.

When it comes to wisdom about the trustworthiness of one’s word, and the use of money and
personal power on the material plane, however, these are people to look to. Their wisdom is released
by accepting that they have nothing to prove, and that they can rely on their Strategy and Authority
to provide for their needs.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED HEART CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self
mental monologue could sound like with an undefined Heart Center: I better do this because if I
don't, I won't be worthy. I have to be in control. I have to be brave. I have to pump myself up so I feel
worthy and good about myself, and then others will see my value. I have to be loyal so that others
will see how valuable I am, and so that I can prove to myself how valuable I am. If I just tell it like
this and make this promise, then they will see how wonderful I am. If] show them how trustworthy
Tam then they will like me. They think I can do this so I better prove to them that I can. If I am in
control then I can prove my worth. I’m not a good wife, lover, friend unless I prove it.
SACRAL CENTER

POWER OF FERTILITY

a : SEXUALITY

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

‘The Sacral Center corresponds to the ovaries in a woman and the testes in a man. All life on the
planet is fostered by the life-force energy generated in this center. It empowers our survival by
replicating life and by providing the impulse to nurture and care for our young. Sexuality, work,
fertility, vitality, movement, and persistence are its major themes.

As the body’s prime motor, the Sacral has enormous power that works in both a generative and a
degenerative way. If we do not understand how to properly engage and support the mechanics of the
Sacral, it will atrophy and degenerate prematurely, leaving one frustrated and unhealthy. This motor's
built-in work/rest cycle requires that it exhausts its supply of available energy each day in order
to sleep well. While it rests, it recharges its batteries. If it is forced to do what it hasn't responded
to, its generative capacity quickly becomes degenerative and burnout results. The Sacral Center's
generating capacity peaks around age 18 in men, and between ages 33-34 in women.

WORK, REPRODUCTION, SEXUALITY AND PERSEVERANCE

Anyone with a defined Sacral Center is a Generator by Type. The Sacral generates the creative
life force, and has the power to guide and sustain life. Its receptive frequency is designed to
respond to what it meets in a protective, healthy, honest, creative and persevering manner.
‘This center distinguishes itself from the other centers in three significant ways: its complexity
(second only to the Throat Center); its capacity to generate the life force; and its ability to
communicate its moment-to-moment availability through its own responsive guttural sounds.
Those sacral sounds emerge out of a trustworthy inner guidance system that existed long before
the capacity for speech evolved. With almost 70 percent of the world’s population capable of
being guided by defined Sacral Centers, there is a huge but as yet untapped potential among
humanity for awakening and awareness.
92 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The receptive Sacral Center is designed to respond to life, to what is being asked of it, by making
expressive noises and sounds. These primal sounds, which do not originate in our Throat Center,
but vibrate from our midsection (like a diaphragm opening or closing), let us know if we have the
energy for something, or not. These sounds tell us if we like what we see or hear, or are asked to do,
or not. Everyone who honors the nature of their Sacral, and the guidance of its sounds, is in touch
with their own power.

‘The sounds can vary person to person, culture to culture, but they are simple and easily recognized.
A ‘yes’ might be an open ended sound like ah- HUH (with the accent on the last syllable), while a
closed UHN-un (emphasis on the first syllable) means ‘no’. If the answer to a question is hmmmm
(or I don’t know), then perhaps the timing is not right or the question needs to be re-phrased. People
with defined Sacral’s do not, and cannot, really know what is correct for them unless they hear their
Sacral’s response. Reconnecting with, and learning to trust in, their sounds once again are the first
steps toward living true to themselves, and establishing the potential for personal transformation.
Generator children make these sounds naturally until they are conditioned to answer with words;
they will make little ah-huh or uhn-un noises when asked yes or no questions. Parents who
encourage such responses when they ask questions, and who honor their child’s inner guidance,
nurture self-confidence.

THE SACRAL DEFINED TO THE THROAT

‘The manifesting energy of Throat-to-motor connections with the Heart, Solar Plexus, and
Root Centers pushes outward or moves toward something or someone, and is described as an
initiating energy. The specific, enveloping energy that the Sacral motor emits naturally draws
life and people into its embrace so it can respond to them, and is described as responsive. This
is why Generators meet with resistance when they try to initiate. They are attempting to reverse
the Sacral’s natural energy flow.

When the Sacral motor is defined to the Throat Center, however, through Channel 34-20 for
example, we have an anomaly where the Sacral’s generative power is converted into a potential for
manifestation. The defined Sacral then has the potential to move immediately from response to
action. People with a Sacral-Throat connection, called Manifesting Generators, often experience
their responses as actual physical movement toward or away from something or someone, rather

THE DEFINED SACRAL CENTER — 66% OF THE POPULATION

‘Those who enter the world with a defined Sacral Center are the custodians of an enormous source of
power. Every day their Sacral motor generates a certain amount of energy that feels like a constant
buzz humming away within them. This is a genuine vitality which can be experienced as restlessness,
an inability to sit still, or a need to burn energy by being active. Nothing is more important for them
than to find personal expression and deep satisfaction by using their daily supply of energy for work or

activities they love to do.

‘The Sacral is very powerful in response. When asked a yes or no question, its immediate response
reveals whether the energy requested is currently available to itself and others, or not. If a response is
affirmative, or moves toward something, the Sacral’s full power is behind the decision. If the response
is unenthusiastic, or the energy feels like it is pulling back, the activity cannot be sustained without

overextending the Sacral’s generative energy.
94 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

For example, when somebody asks, “Do you want to learn how to play tennis?” and you hear the
Sacral say “uhn un,” that is the truth. And this truth must be honored because it is the only way
defined Sacrals will know if they have the energy for what they are being asked to do. In practical
terms, what they heard was their Sacral voice telling them that the energy is not available at this
time. Each negative Sacral response sets a clear and healthy boundary that protects them from
potential harm, embarrassment or from merely overextending their energy. They cannot stick with
commitments they have not entered correctly through response. Sacral energy is simply not available
to support decisions made with your mind. This is why it is essential to know how to respond, and
how to correctly engage this energy in productive and fulfilling ways. If Generators allow a mental
decision to usurp their Sacral’s immediate response, they will most likely meet resistance, experience
exhaustion, frustration and unhappiness, or quit.

Not completing what they have started has earned Generators a reputation for being the great
quitters of the world. Avoiding this scenario begins with understanding that the nature of the
Sacral’s frequency is to persevere in order to master a skill or achieve competency. This energy is set
in motion and sustained by response, by correctly committing their energy to begin with. Unlike
manifestation, which occurs through the Throat Center, Sacral energy reaches plateaus and must
have the power to persist through those ‘stuck’ points until a sudden breakthrough (initiation)
propels one to the next level of mastery. Without Sacral energy, these recurring plateaus can become
insurmountable obstacles, sources of frustration, fatigue and the temptation to quit. The only way
that those with a defined Sacral can make sure that their persevering Sacral energy is firmly behind
them from the beginning is through an affirmative response.

The mantra and Strategy, therefore, for the defined Sacral Center is ‘do not initiate.’ Never take
the first step or move toward something without being asked so it can respond. The moment one
initiates, the connection to the sacral source of the power to persevere is broken. The secret is to wait,
and keep the Sacral available so that it can respond to exactly what is right for each of us individually.
Listening to the primal sounds of the Sacral responses tells one if there is energy available. Knowing
that there is reliable energy to fulfill a commitment, and finding satisfaction in doing it, builds a
Generator'’s confidence in making decisions that are correct, and builds trust in sacral sounds.

Others can feel the powerful and available resources of a defined Sacral Center, and they will want
to take advantage of this energy. Letting the mind talk the Sacral into doing something that is
not right for it, will simply lead to frustration, and a society of ‘slaves’ working with no energy
at something they do not love. We must honor the Sacral’s limitations by honoring its guidance
through the sounds it makes.

Perhaps the hardest thing for people with Sacral definition to accept is that their trustworthy response
is a mechanical process, and neither rational nor aware. Responses are not judgments of right or
wrong, and they do not come with the rational or articulated vocabulary to explain them. Response
is so pure that it bypasses awareness altogether. Generators often describe it as life making a decision
through them, and that’s exactly what happens. It doesn’t matter what they ‘think’ their life should
look like, as the life force knows what is correct for them, and what they have energy for. This is
their truth. Their patient and expectant waiting allows the universe to bring life to them, while their
responses attune them to the ebb and flow of the unique path and pupose they are here to live.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 95

THE UNDEFINED SACRAL CENTER — 34% OF THE POPULATION

The undefined Sacral Center is always vulnerable to the intense conditioning field (or buzz) created
by the majority of human beings on the planet with defined Sacrals. It is extremely sensitive to
the energy levels in people and places, and is capable of magnifying those energies. Those with
undefined Sacral’s are subject to elevated levels of energy pumping through bodies that are not
equipped to handle it. They often run on this ‘borrowed’ energy, and over-extend themselves, leading
to breakdown and exhaustion. Not designed to live in response, they can never rely on their own
sounds to guide their decisions, or to tell them when enough is enough.

Without a defined Sacral Center, the Manifestor, Projector, and Reflector types, are particularly
subject to energy excesses. They are not born knowing when enough is enough, or how to establish
healthy boundaries for themselves. With their undefined Sacral filled to overflowing by other
people's energy, they are always busy with work and family and never know when to quit. They take
on too much and feel like slaves, but don't really know what to do about it. When they recognize
they are tired, they override this and push on through, jeopardizing their health. They don’t know
when (or understand how) to pull away from the Sacral energy around them and realign with their
own personal Authority.

It is difficult for them to know when it is correct to enter a situation/relationship versus when to
wait, or how long to stay or when to get out. They are constantly taking in other people’s Sacral fuel,
so it is wise to make sure that the fuel is the right kind for their vehicle. Understanding how they
connect to the people around them is the key to maintaining their vitality and a healthy open Sacral,
and this can only be achieved by experimenting with their Strategy and Authority.

The Sacral Center is about the availability, or not, of pure, generative, life-force energy, particularly
sexual energy. The undefined Sacral has no consistent boundaries, and with a potential for deep
conditioning in this area, can be anywhere from mildly curious to obsessed with sex. Each sexual
experience will be unique because the undefined Sacral is being conditioned either positively or
negatively by its partner. This information is especially important for teenagers as they mature. The
potential wisdom of this undefined center is to learn about healthy sex and safe boundaries, and
to be able to discern when enough is enough. This includes learning to rely on their Strategy and
Authority to enter relationships correctly in the first place.

Consistent levels of generative and persevering energy are not available to people with an undefined
Sacral; the energy is there and then it’s not there. If they understand and respect this, they will take
time to rest when rest is needed. They should not ignore their energy levels. Failure to properly
manage their energy can lead to serious sleep problems, resulting in insufficient, non-rejuvenating
rest. Just as they amplify the defined Sacral’s energy, they can also magnify its fatigue, erroneously
thinking it is their own. The healthy bedtime practice for undefined Sacral’s is to go to bed early,
before they are tired, to ease into sleep. They need this quiet time alone to release the Sacral energy
buzz they have taken in during the day.
96 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Most people with undefined Sacrals, when truly honest, admit they don't really want to work. They
would love to relax and let others do the hard work. When we observe those with undefined Sacrals,
however, this usually is not what we experience because the Sacral is one of the most easily and
deeply conditioned centers. The sheer number of defined Sacrals, and size of the overall Generator
field on the planet, easily overwhelms undefined Sacrals.

When at peace with their undefined Sacral, however, the three open-Sacral Types are relaxed, have
healthy boundaries, and through their Authority know when enough is enough. They work in spurts,
taking plenty of time for rest. They respect their inconsistent energy flow. They enjoy taking in the
life-force energy of others without responding to it or identifying with it. They balance their work
with rest, and become wise about the ways the creative, powerful and responsive energy of the Sacral
operates, and can be best utilized by those who are generating it.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN SACRAL CENTER

‘The completely open Sacral does not know what to use its energy for. It finds its own energy
scattered all over the place, drawn to this thing or that thing. There is no longer a question of
knowing when enough is enough; it merely waits for exhaustion from inappropriate and excessive
activity to overwhelm it so it can stop.

Many have been drawn through this openness into a fascination with who we are and why we exist.
People with completely open Sacral’s like Krishnamurti, Osho and Ra Uru Hu have given us deep
insights into the nature of being. The wisdom available here is that one can truly measure the life
force — can become wise about what energy is really for — and can then express or describe the many
qualities this unique energy makes available to humanity. .

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED SACRAL CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say or
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-self
mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Sacral Center: Let’s keep working. We really
need to get this done. We need to say yes to that otherwise we might miss out on something. I can
keep going. Let me just get a cup of coffee. We can do that too. Not a problem. We're not tired yet.
I don’t want to take a nap or lay down — there’s too much to do. Let’s take care of that for them. I
have to do it myself. Let’s go find a mate. Who can we take care of? Life is juicy - who wants to
say no. Yes, we are doing all the work but then someone has to do it.I don't think it’s enough yet.
Boundaries? What boundaries?

[\e G CENTER

Love, IDENTITY AND
DIRECTION
vy (SEAT OF) THE
oe MAGNETIC MONOPOLE,
HIGHER SELF

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION

Biologically, the G Center is associated with the liver and the blood. Liver function determines the
health of our blood, and blood carries nutrients and oxygen to every organ and cell in the body. Once
liver cells are damaged, they cannot be replaced. We know that alcohol destroys the liver and robs a
person of their identity. The spiritual nature of this center has its roots in Indo-European traditions
which held that reincarnation took place through the liver. This coincides with The Human Design
System’s understanding of the role of the Magnetic Monopole in our incarnating process. It draws
us into a body and leaves when that body dies.

LOVE, IDENTITY AND DIRECTION

LOVE: The G Center is the most extraordinary center in the BodyGraph. Its essential and mystical
component, the Magnetic Monopole, is a magnet with a single pole. (Everything else in Human
Design exists as a binary.) This single pole only attracts, and what it attracts is love and beauty. Take
a moment to look at your own Mandala. Notice the spokes of your definition radiating from the
outer wheels inward toward the yellow diamond at the center of the BodyGraph. The G Center’s
strategic position illuminates its importance in the Mandala and in our life. It illustrates how the
cosmic/planetary influences revolve around this center, while the Magnetic Monopole within it
draws toward us what is specifically ours (by definition) to experience over the course of our lifetime.
We are designed to live that love which is attracted to us, beginning with loving ourselves.

Prior to our incarnation, the Magnetic Monopole and the Design Crystal fit together perfectly. As
the baby’s body forms during pregnancy, the Design Crystal moves into the Ajna Center and the
Magnetic Monopole takes up residence in the G Center, creating what is described as the illusion
of separateness. Their separation creates a sort of longing between them that we experience as a
life-long search for love. And love, in one form or another, is what life is all about. This feeling of
98 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

separation is what drives us to look outside ourselves for love, trying to get a sense of where we are
going and who we are in relation to others. We are trying to become worthy of the illusive love we
seek. The mind takes advantage of this seeking and, through our open centers, exaggerates both our
longing and our desire to know ourselves. The joke is that everything has been right here within us
all along; we do not have to look outside ourselves to discover who we are, or where to go to find love.
‘The G Center holds love. Love is the force that permeates and binds the universe, pulling everything
toward a state of oneness again. Surrendering to the direction of our form is how we are designed to
experience the fullness of that love.

“WE ARE NOT HERE TO BE LOVED, BUT TO BE LOVE.” — RA URU HU

IDENTITY: The Magnetic Monopole is responsible for several aspects of our experience of life, from
before birth to after death. One aspect is creating our identity during life by holding the Personality
and Design Crystals in quantum in our BodyGraph. This unique and individual blueprint separates
or differentiates us from everyone else. Even if we don’t have a conscious or enduring sense of our
self, we can know, and literally see in the BodyGraph, that it is there.

DIRECTION: Another aspect is the internal pull exerted by the Magnetic Monopole which holds
us in our place within the totality, and keeps us on our path. It is like having our own inner GPS,
and this pull allows our unique role in life to naturally play out. Without it we would have no sense
of differentiation; we would feel at one with the totality rather than being individuated. There would
also be nothing to hold us together, along with everything else in the universe, in our perceived
separateness. It is the Magnetic Monopole that differentiates or separates us, and its mysterious and
mystical attracting force is called love. Our Personality and Design Crystals are held together like
two people in a forced marriage. Once we accept their specific roles, and resolve our own internal
conflict between these two sides of our being, we can attain a state of self-acceptance, and self-love.
Only then are we capable of receiving and giving the love we enter life yearning for.

The Magnetic Monopole knows where we are, where we are going and how to get us there. It
attracts all the people, places, and events that we are here to encounter to us, determining the
way life itself is attracted to and authentically lived through us. We call this movement in time
through space our trajectory, or direction. We are moved along this trajectory one correct decision
at a time. It is futile to go looking for anything since living correctly will bring to us the life and
the love that is perfect for us. We have a driver to get us there, and all we have to do is sit back,
and through our Strategy and Authority, let the Magnetic Monopole guide our vehicle.

“SINCE THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING HAS BEEN MOVING UNI-DIRECTIONALLY IN SPACE.
EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS, IN ANY SHAPE, STATE OR FORM, IS PART OF THIS MOVEMENT.
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE GREAT LAWS OF SCIENCE, “NO TWO OBJECTS CAN OCCUPY THE
SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME,” EVERYTHING THAT IS MOVING, AND EVERYTHING IS MOVING,
HAS A UNIQUE GEOMETRY. OUR LIVES ARE ABOUT GEOMETRY. THE ANCIENTS REFER TO THIS
AS DESTINY. THIS WORD HOWEVER OFTEN IMPLIES PREDETERMINATION. THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DESTINY AND GEOMETRY CAN BE BEST SEEN IN THE WAY THE TWO EXPLAIN DEATH.
DESTINY, PREDETERMINATION SAYS THE “TIME” OF DEATH IS FIXED, WRITTEN. GEOMETRY
SAYS, ONLY THAT THE “DIRECTION” TOWARDS DEATH IS FIXED. — RA URU HU
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 99

INCARNATION CROSSES OF THE VESSEL OF LOVE AND THE SPHINX

When placed within the Mandala, the eight gates of the diamond-shaped G Center form a symmetrical
configuration that brings the 12 signs of the Zodiac from the inner wheel into a conversation with
the eight gates of the G Center in the outer wheel. The Mandala illustrates the way the Magnetic
Monopole, through its core of love inside us, draws our life to us from the macrocosm of the universe
that surrounds and informs us.

Two pivotal Incarnation Crosses are represented in this configuration. The first is the Cross of the Vessel
of Love. Its four gates represent the love of humanity (Gate 15), the love of self (Gate 10), universal
love, the ability to love existence without discrimination (Gate 25), and the love of the body (Gate 46).
‘The Magnetic Monopole regulates the mechanics of these transpersonal forms of love as well as their
integral opposites, forms of hate. Without the longing the Magnetic Monopole creates in its separation
from the Design Crystal, or without
the tension between the Design (red)
and Personality (black) that it holds in
quantum as our identity, there would be
no place to experience the push/pull of a
love/hate binary. We live in a duality, and
one cannot exist without the other. What
we seek is balance and harmony between
them. The Cross of the Sphinx, which
represents direction, is the second. With
separation and differentiation comes the
need for a reference point from which to
take our bearings, a point of comparison.
If there were no differentiation of the
self, there would be no direction and no
need for us to have one. If all is one, there
is nowhere to go. Three of the four gates
of the Cross of the Sphinx operate like
perspectives that points us toward the
past, the present, or the future. The fourth
gate is the driver (Gate 2). The driver can
look at its place in the now (Gate 1), it
can look back (Gate 13), or it can look ahead (Gate 7). These same four gates are also called role gates,
and our role in life is lived out according to the correctness of our geometry, our direction.

‘The complex and fascinating mathematics, beauty, and symmetry of these two crosses are explored
in greater detail in advanced courses of study, but of note here is how the Cross of the Vessel of
Love encompasses the full cycle of life. Its four gates mark the beginning of each of the four
seasons. The vernal (spring) equinox takes place when the sun enters the 25th gate. The summer
solstice is celebrated when the sun enters the 15th gate. The autumnal equinox occurs when the
sun enters the 46th gate, and the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, begins when the sun
enters the 10th gate.

THE DEFINED G CENTER — 57% OF THE POPULATION

‘Those with a defined G Center have a fixed and reliable self-identity, a sense of being loved and
loveable. Secure in their love for themselves, they can love others without becoming dependent on
them. They have a sense of their own correct direction or mission in life, and are naturals at pointing
out new directions — and possibly new loves — for others. With a deep sense of connectedness
to their center, they have the capacity to comfort people who are concerned about the direction
humanity is heading in, by helping them understand the nature of our evolution as a species.

A common dilemma for them, especially if not relying on their Authority, is expecting everyone to
go wherever they are going, even though they don't always know where life will take them or how
they will get there. This can be divisive if they try to direct or lead others without waiting to be asked
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 101

or invited; if they forget that not everyone is designed to go the same way they are going. What they
don't understand is that they cannot change or control their own direction, so if another person isn't
comfortable with it or able to follow along, both parties need to be free to follow their own path.
Although their G Center is defined, succumbing to expectations imposed on them or conditioned
by others, while rejecting their own direction and thereby denying themselves love, can lead them to
experience such a sense of loss in their life that they give up on themselves altogether.

THE UNDEFINED G CENTER — 43% OF THE POPULATION

People with undefined G Centers have no fixed identity. This is not a handicap, and there is absolutely
nothing wrong with them. What is difficult for them to comprehend is living without knowing who
they are, or having a consistent and reliable sense of identity. No one truly knows the parameters
of their open personality — and neither do they! They blend in or adapt to the people they interact
with, and they can fit in anywhere or nowhere. One way or the other, they are always subject to the
auric influences (definition) of the people in their environment. They are here to be initiated into
the many ways there are of ‘being.’ Over time, a comfortable sort of identity emerges for them when
they are in stable relationships that are correct and supportive of them.

‘They are most vulnerable to begin with in relationships, because opposites still attract. A person with
definition is naturally attracted to a person with an open center — and vice versa. Those with open
G Centers gain security from a sense of ‘borrowed’ identity and direction, and those with a defined
G Center see themselves reflected back and think, “They are just like me.” If open G’s are aligned
with their own design, they will recognize that what the other person sees is merely a reflection, and
the defined G’s will recognize that their partner is NOT just like them. If the relationship continues
while ignorant of the differences, the defined partner will impose themselves, their identity and their
direction, without realizing what is happening.

People with an undefined G are not without direction. They do have an internal direction finder that is
always working, but not in the same way as a defined G Center. Undefined G Centers will be directed
here or taken there, and can be conditioned to go most anywhere by others. It is part of their path. This
sampling of directions is the way they determine which one is correct for them. They also collect places
that are right for them that they can return to, such as the right places to eat, shop, work, and play.

‘The mantra for the undefined G Center is: if you are in the wrong place, you are with the wrong
people/person. The undefined G is specially equipped to sense when the environment they are in
isn't correct for them. If someone takes them to a restaurant, home, store or office that doesn’t feel
right, they will automatically transfer that feeling of unease to the person who took them there, to
the people they meet there, or to proposals or commitments suggested while there.

As an example, you might take a woman with an open/undefined G to a restaurant in order to
introduce her to a potential business partner, but if the restaurant is the wrong place for her, the
connection can't work. Try changing restaurants. When you find the one that is right for her,
then the viability of the connection can be accurately assessed. This is how undefined G Centers
discover others on their trajectory. It’s all about place. When those with an undefined G are in the
102 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

right place, the direction of their life is correct, and the people they meet will be correct. They will
thrive as their undefined center amplifies and reflects the correct energy of people around them,
as if where they are is what they are. In other words, the wrong house, job or relationship can be
the cause of great unhappiness.

‘The beauty of having this center open is that people around the Open G often become their willing
allies, full of suggestions and eager to help. New directions and new loves are brought to them all
the time. Friends show them where everything is, and take them to to the correct people, places and
jobs. The undefined G Center's not-self question is, “Am I still trying to find direction and love?”
‘When aligned with their vehicles, they do not have to find anything themselves. In fact, they cannot
find it for themselves. It doesn't work that way for them.

Let’s say you need a new place to live. You would begin by calling your friends and realtors with a
description of exactly what you are looking for. Then you sit back and wait to see what they show
you. By visiting each place they have found for you, you will get a sense of which one is correct
for you. Once you find that place, you do not owe the people anything other than their fee and an
expression of gratitude for showing it to you. They were merely being of service to you which is their
proper role in your life. The same strategy applies to love. The moment you stop chasing after love, it
comes to you. Understanding and accepting that you are designed to wait for others to initiate you
to your direction and place can be profoundly liberating. People with an undefined G Center need
their independence, and need to have people around them who support their freedom to explore the
expansiveness of their lives. If they find themselves in a relationship that is not correct, they will feel
trapped and begin looking for a way out!

Making sure that a child with an undefined G Center feels comfortable in their bedroom or special
playroom can mean the difference between simply existing and thriving in their formative years. If
there is anything about a place that is uncomfortable or unpleasant, change it whenever possible.
‘The same applies to school. If school does not feel like a good place, the child will not thrive or learn.
Even moving the student to a different seat can make a difference.

A powerful and cogent motivation underlying the thinking of undefined G’s is, “Which direction
will take me to love?” Almost every decision the mind makes through its dialogue with the not-self
is filtered by this question, “Is this where I will find love?” The not-self can become obsessed with
where they are headed, and when they are going to find love. It prods them to search for identity
by trying to understand who they are. They can become preoccupied with earning titles and adding
letters behind their name so they can say, “I am a doctor or professor or lawyer.” They initiate over
and over again only to meet resistance. Not knowing who they are leads them to believe something
is wrong with them, and this sends them searching for the illusive self. Life without a fixed sense
of direction can feel disorienting. And place seems to be a mystery because it’s not about what our
mind thinks it is. When people with an undefined G try to understand themselves with their minds,
they miss both love and correct direction. Strategy and Authority are always the solution for this.

When at peace with themselves, undefined G’s do not need to anticipate their next move, or when
love will come again. They are comfortable waiting for something or someone in the environment to
initiate them. They realize that it is not up to them and trust that they will be shown the way. They
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 103

do not become attached to the people who take them to the correct place or love; they simply thank
them and move on. This frees them to be comfortable with all types of people, and discerning about
who is living life authentically.

Instead of feeling lost, people with undefined G Centers can enjoy what is being shown to
them; they can enjoy the people and places they encounter, and are free to take advantage of the
guidance given by others. They can tell us what love and direction are because they take in all the
possibilities of love, and experience all the different directions. Though they can never see their
destination, they know each next step will be revealed if they live as themselves. Ultimately, there
are no better guides in life than those with undefined G Centers. By letting go of their need for
identity and love, they can step into anyone’s shoes and offer loving, correct guidance. They are
here to become wise about the ways identity is expressed through a person's behavior. Many great
actors of stage and screen have undefined G's with no strong fixed identity of their own. By taking
the role (identity) they are to act deeply into themselves, they can reflect it back as a convincing
and compelling portrayal of that character.

THE COMPLETELY OPEN G CENTER

A completely open G Center leaves one without clear identifiable personality parameters and an
inherent sense of direction. If not grounded in their personal Authority, completely open G’s feel
afloat and unsure of themselves, turning to others to identify and direct them, and to affirm their
lovability. This leaves them vulnerable to manipulation, and open to the conditioning dictates of
others. Once they give their authority over to another person, authority figure, or institution, they
can no longer live out their true potential.

Over time, as they become comfortable with the openness of their design, they do discover their
way or direction, and a sense of their unique being. Like those with undefined G’s, their broad
experience and comprehension of the nature of being, self love, and the way we are designed to
move through life, is wisdom we can all benefit from.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED G CENTER

‘The not-self mind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say
or do, Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples of what the not-
self mental monolog could sound like with an undefined G Center: Who am I? Where should I
go to find out who I am? Who can show me? Who am I going to love? Who is going to love me?
How do I find them? Where can I find them? What am I going to do with my life? Where should
I go to figure out what to do with my life? Is it there? Is it here? Where is it? Do I feel lost? Let's
go here because we might find something that will show me who I am or what to do with my life.
Let’s have a relationship with this person because I will get a sense of who I am.

SECTION THREE
AUTHORITY

OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH

In Section Two of this book, you were introduced to the myriad ways your strong and gifted mind
tries to be the authority for your life, convinced that it knows what's best for you. Your mind will use
and think anything in order to maintain its semblance of control, which makes it part of the dilemma
that we face as highly differentiated beings. You can make an ally of your mind, however, by defining
and honoring your Authority, and deepening your understanding of your Type’s Strategy. Practiced
together, these tools free the mind to observe the life of the Form as a relaxed, reflective passenger
able to enjoy its ride and fill its role as an Outer Authority for others.

The Human Design System teaches human beings how to live by their own authority; how to
make decisions that are individually correct. Although we are all conditioned to seek approval and
authority outside ourselves, and to make decisions from the mind, we do have a trustworthy personal
Authority that we can actually rely on to make choices. When we intentionally practice our Strategy
and Authority, we align with our unique geometry (path), and our genetic makeup, our reason for
incarnating and our uniqueness are all expressed through us as our True Self. Things just naturally
fall into place, such as where we live, our job and our relationships.

‘There are several centers in the BodyGraph that can be defined as a personal Authority, and each
represents a different way or mode of making decisions. The hierarchy of modes is listed below
and elaborated upon in the pages following. Once the mind has been freed from decision-making,
it can take its rightful place in our life as a valued and valuable witness of our life, and Outer

Authority for others.

THE HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY

Solar Plexus (Emotional Authority)
Sacral (Sacral Authority)

Spleen (Splenic Authority)

Heart (Ego Authority)

G (Self Authority)

Environment (No Inner Authority)
Moon (Lunar Cycle)

Your personal Authority is listed on your Human Design chart. Each type of Authority is described

in the summaries that follow.
SECTION THREE: AUTHORITY, OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH 107

SOLAR PLEXUS AUTHORITY

When the Solar Plexus Center is defined, it takes precedence over all
a other authority centers in a chart. In Section Two we discovered that
: the Solar Plexus operates through an emotional wave, and that waiting
for clarity is the key to living in harmony. Fifty percent of the people
on the planet have a defined Solar Plexus and are designed to wait out
their emotional wave before making a decision. Their motto is ‘there is
no truth in the now.’ Truth reveals itself in its fullness over time, and
emerges eventually as a sense of clarity. Patience is the key component
in waiting out the emotional wave before making a decision. As there is
no truth in the moment, spontaneous decisions are untrustworthy and
not-self based decisions. Time is the key with this Authority; the more
time the better. Time puts distance between the moment a decision is called for and the decision
itself. As you wait you will gain clarity, although total clarity or total certainty is rare. The goal is
to become as clear as possible.

It’s best to avoid making decisions from the emotionally charged high or low points along your
wave, as this sends chaos into the world and usually results in regret. Depth is not accessible to
you in the immediacy of the present moment. Though it’s difficult to contain the impulse to react
immediately, its best to wait for calm waters before you make your decision. Remember, your
truth (clarity) comes to you over time. As you surrender to the depths of your uncertainty you can
move beyond the ‘for or against’ reaction of the moment. You can use this built-in waiting period
for discernment, and to avoid making spontaneous mistakes. The Solar Plexus is a potent motor
and a source of warm, seductive energy that others desire access to. Waiting for clarity can often
be used to your advantage. If you ask others to wait while you take time to properly consider their
offer, they may find you or your abilities even more essential and attractive to them, assuming
what they are offering is correct for both of you. By experimenting, you will learn and understand
this form of decision-making, and discover for yourself just how powerful it can be to wait.

SACRAL AUTHORITY

‘When the Sacral Center is defined without the Solar Plexus Center, we
have Sacral Authority, the domain of the Generator. Usually the Sacral
voice or familiar ah-huh (yes) or uhn-un (no) is immediately heard or
felt when Generators are asked to commit their energy to an activity or
relationship. If there is any hesitation, such as hnmmm, the answer is, “I
don't know right now — ask me again later or ask me in a different way.”
Sacral Authority shows Generators, through response, what is correct
for them, what their boundaries are, and what they currently have energy
to support and engage with. As compared to the Solar Plexus Center
which shows its truth over time, this is truth in present time. The Sacral
Center only functions in the present moment, it can't predict the future. Its responses tell you
whose energy or requests are correct for you, and if your energy is available to give to others or a

108 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

task. When you hear your Sacral give the go-ahead, you know you will have the energy resources
to persevere until you bring the task or relationship to completion, or until you don't have the
energy for it any longer. Sacral response is a reliable, honest and trustworthy guide to reducing
resistance and maximizing satisfaction.

After many years of conditioning, however, you may find that you need to re-connect with your
Sacral response. One good way is to find people who can ask your Sacral ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions. When
you are asked, let your sacral response flow immediately. It may take a little time to get comfortable
with your Sacral answering, but the more you do it, the clearer your response will become. This
is a wonderful way to reawaken and re-strengthen your response, and successfully re-engage this
always-ready-to-respond inner guidance system.

SPLENIC AUTHORITY

When the defined Splenic Center stands alone without Sacral or Solar
se Plexus definition, one has Splenic Authority. This can be felt as an
instantaneous resonance or recognition with something or someone,
and an inner knowing as to whether it is healthy for you — or not. Our
highly evolved survival intelligence alerts us to which environments,
direction, opportunities and people are safe and advantageous for us to
engage with, and which ones aren't.

‘This type of authority requires a deep level of attention to many subtle
physiological sensations, and an ability to act if necessary and correct,
no matter what the consequences. The Splenic voice speaks softly and does not repeat itself.
Staying in the present and tuned into what your body is telling you is critical to your survival.
‘This is a purely existential authority designed to keep you safe. Do not allow your mind, or the
emotional needs, wants and pressures of others, to cause you to second guess or override your
Splenic Center’s messages.

‘The Splenic Center is constantly and spontaneously communicating with you about your moment-
to-moment well-being, so there is great wisdom available in listening to its alerts. Those with Splenic
Authority don't have time to go deep, and to ponder the broader ramifications of their decisions
over time. Decisions must be made in the moment. Wait, and the moment and information is gone.

‘The Splenic Center is not aware of the future, and 10 minutes or an hour or a day later, what was
correct for you may change, and your activity along with it. You will ‘know’ instinctively when
something is correct and safe for you in the now moment, and when it is not. To reaquaint yourself
with and honor your Spleen’s guidance requires experimentation, and a deep trust in the inherent
wisdom of your vehicle to take you safely where, how and with whom you need to go.
SECTION THREE: AUTHORITY, OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH 109

HEART CENTER (EGO) MANIFESTED AUTHORITY

Ego Manifested Authority is driven by the Heart Center’s motor to
manifest. Manifested Authority is about articulation. Your Authority
is expressed through the Throat Center verbally, and it is important for
you to listen to what you ‘say’ in order to know your truth, rather than
what your mind is telling you. Your informing as a Manifestor needs to
be verbalized in the moment, as it is not what you think you should say,
but rather what you do say when you are not trying to control it. The
not-self is always trying to control what we say and, in effect, whatever
you blurt out in the moment (bypassing the mind) is your truth. If you
try to script what you say in any manner you have lost your connection to
your Authority. You are designed to have impact, and it is important for you to trust what you say
without the mind overriding it. Surrendering to the truth of your voice is key for you; this is where
your impact comes from. With so many open centers competing for your attention, you cannot
trust your not-self mind to speak for you. Your voice initiates and runs your life. Your voice leads
and you follow. Trust in your voice.

HEART CENTER (EGO) PROJECTED AUTHORITY

For those with Ego Projected Authority, the Heart connects to the G

Center through the Channel of Initiation (Channel 25-51). This is a rare

form of Projector, and Strategy and Authority are essential to these beings

as the only thing they can trust is waiting for the invitation. With a very

powerful G Center of identity surrounded by several undefined centers, it

is easy for you to get lost in all of this openness. Following your Projector
wes Strategy of waiting to be recognized and invited is the key as there is no
motor connected to the Throat Center. You need people in your life to
come to you and invite you. Projector leadership is a powerful force in
other people's lives, and is here to guide us. You have an enormous capacity
to be a transformative force when invited. If lost in the not-self openness, however, you will not find
the success that is available to a Projector in life. When making a decision, be selfish and ask, “What
do I want? What is in it for me?” The Heart Center is a motor, and you will either have the will
(energy) to do something or you won't. While you are waiting to be recognized, it is also important
that you use the time to prepare by learning about a system(s) that will help you guide others.

In either form of Ego Authority, or even if not the Authority, a defined Heart Center stays healthy
by making and keeping promises, and proving that it has the will to complete what it appropriately
committed to doing. To avoid taxing the physical heart, one must be correct when entering into
situations that require a commitment of energy over a prolonged period of time.

In addition, the defined Heart must have a balance between work and rest. In effect, the Heart Center
works so that it can also have the time to play. Maintaining this balance is essential energetically as
well as physically.
110 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

SELF-PROJECTED AUTHORITY

Self-Projected Authority originates out of the G Center and connects
to the Throat Center through one of four channels. The key with this
Authority is to listen to what you say. Whatever you need to know is in
3 what you say, and you have a G Center, a very powerful voice of identity,
rs that speaks for you in reaction to an invitation. Your truth is always
a expressed through the core of your identity. If there is no truth for you,
ie ES there is no success for you. When you are invited, listen to what you say.
Ze Don't try and figure out mentally what you are going to say; simply listen

to and trust your own voice at that moment.

‘There are no motors present in this type of Authority, and you can become totally lost in the
conditioning through your open centers. It can be easy for you to ignore your own voice in the
moment, and thus not fulfill what it is to be uniquely you. You are designed to be guided in your
decisions by what makes you feel like you, and brings ‘you’ enjoyment and pleasure. Ask yourself,
“Will this make me happy? Will this give me self expression? Am I heading in the right direction
for me?” Discussing your impending decisions with others in order to hear yourself, to sense what
level of self-satisfaction your decision might bring, is very helpful. To avoid making a decision from
your mind, focus on listening to what you are saying without thinking about it. People with a
defined G Center often provide direction for others, but only hear their own direction by listening
to what they themselves are saying in the moment.

ENVIRONMENT (MENTAL PROJECTORS)

A Mental Projector can have the Ajna Center connected to the Head
Center, or the Ajna Center connected to the Throat Center, or the
Head, Ajna and Throat Centers all connected to each other. To have
no center of inner personal Authority is rare and unique. When there
are no centers defined below the Throat Center, we have a design that
receives guidance from sensory information about the environment
through its open centers. If the environment feels wrong, the people
you are with, or ideas exchanged and bargains made there, will not be
right either. The first question to ask is, “Is this environment correct for
me?” The caution here is to be aware of the strength of your mind and
its tendency to intervene in decision-making. When making a decision about what the correct
environment is for you, it is healthy and beneficial to physically visit the environments in question,
and notice and recognize within your body how they ‘feel’ to you.

Though it is good for you to have a group of trusted advisers to turn to, its best mot to discuss a
decision in order to get opinions or advice. Your advisers are best used as sounding boards in order
for you to hear your own ruminations about the decision.
SECTION THREE: AUTHORITY, OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH - 1

LUNAR AUTHORITY (REFLECTORS)

When no centers are defined, we have a Reflector whose Authority is Lunar,
and is determined by the Moon's 28-day cycle through the Mandala as it
visits each of the 64 Gates. Before making important decisions, Reflectors
are designed to wait through their personal and consistent monthly
pattern of lunar transits, which repeats each month for as long as they
live. If they understand and follow this pattern, they can achieve clarity in
their decision-making process, and enjoy being constantly surprised and
delighted by a Reflector’s life. If they do not honor their Lunar cycle, they
may suffer disappointment and dis-ease. A key for Reflectors is to slow
down and not let the world rush them.

It is important for Reflectors to pay attention to the environment, as they mirror it. The core of
the Reflector is their undefined G Center, and being in the correct place with the correct people
is imperative to their well-being. If the environment does not feel good to them, or is unhealthy,
they won't feel well, or will be ill-at-ease. Conversely, if the environment feels good, they feel good.
Reflectors must also have trustworthy advisers or confidantes with whom to discuss any situation
and potential decision during this cycle. By hearing themselves talk over time, Reflectors will one
day simply arrive at an inner knowing, a deep inner sense of which decision is correct for them.
Please see Reflectors in Section Four for more information.

THE LIBERATED MIND AS AN OUTER AUTHORITY

Following our Strategy connects us to our own personal Authority. When we are operating as
our unique authentic self, our undefined centers become places of great wisdom. Rather than
conditioning us in a distorted way, these undefined centers inform us clearly and accurately about
what is going on in the world around us. Once we are on track and aligned with our correct geometry,
the mind can begin revealing its own potential as an extraordinary Outer Authority for others. It
can express our intelligence, commune with others to share our unique experiences and perceptions,
and inspire them with what we have learned. The mind is here to think, question, interpret, teach,
inspire, remember, organize, name and process data. These are ways we share the gifts of our mind
with those who are here to receive them, and respond to them from their own Authority.

‘The more we practice our Strategy and Authority, and liberate the mind from making decisions, the
more valuable our Outer Authority becomes to others. Once aligned with our true nature, we are
in tune with our own life force energy and our true purpose in life. Something of unique value then
naturally emerges from the mind, something others have been waiting to hear. And our liberated
mind regains the potential to ultimately express our unique reason for incarnating.

SECTION FOUR
THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES

LIVING OUR DESIGN

MANIFESTOR GENERATOR

REFLECTOR

PROJECTOR

‘The shift that heralded the appearance of Homo Sapiens in Transitus, in 1781, also precipitated the
division of humanity into four distinct Types: Manifestors, Generators, Projectors and Reflectors.
Type embodies the essence of The Human Design System, and is the basis for its most practical,
empowering and transformative information — Strategy and Authority. In The Human Design
System, Type concerns the body, our genetics, and our aura; it has nothing to do with psychological
or personality typing. Each Type defines a particular mode of operating energetically, and a prime
auric frequency that is as distinguishable as our blood type. Our practical use of Type is based on an
understanding of the subtle and unconscious dynamics of human interaction through the aura. What
we communicate through our aura is determined by our body’s genetic makeup, which we see defined
in our BodyGraph. Definition determines Type, and Type is expressed through our aura.

‘The four Types are grouped according to their ability to consistently generate or initiate energy, or not.
‘There are two ‘energy’ types (Manifestor and Generator) and two ‘non-energy’ types (Projector and
Reflector). Non-energy types do not have constant access to their own generating and manifesting
capacity, and their available energy and stamina for work is not reliably available to them. Following
their Strategy maximizes their available energy potential.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 115

OUR AURIC PRESENCE IN THE WORLD

“AURAS ARE A FULL EXPRESSION OF THE BEING, AND A CONTROLLING AGENT OF
THE WAY THE FORM IS GOING TO WORK. AURAS ARE THE WAY WE CONNECT TO AND
ARE EXPERIENCED BY THE OTHER.” — RA URU HU

‘There is an electromagnetic energy field surrounding and extending outward from every living
thing. In the case of human beings, that field extends about two arm lengths in every direction
from the body. Auric connectivity is a powerful and non-verbal form of communication that
cannot be ignored. If we understand and honor the key differences between Types at this auric level,
we create the potential to interact and communicate successfully and amicably with one another on
all levels. The provocative nature of our aura does the talking for us: Generator auras provoke others
to ask them so they can respond; Projector auras provoke recognition and the invitation; Manifestor
auras challenge or initiate; and Reflector auras provoke others to look to them for their reflection/
assessment. Each Type can relax into their strategy with confidence when they understand and
allow their aura to do the work for them.

In order to evolve and fulfill our purpose, as highly social beings we are here to commune with
others. Part of what it means to know and love ourselves, to express our own uniqueness with
compassion, is to appreciate and respect the uniqueness of others. Mastering auric communication
between Types begins with Strategy.

STRATEGY REFLECTS EACH TYPE’S UNIQUE AURIC MODE

When we talk about an individual's Strategy by Type in Human Design, we are referring to a way
of being in the world without resistance; a method that aligns us with our unique geometry in the
overall flow of the totality, and supports the process of becoming our authentic self. Strategy is not a
philosophy; it is based on the way our vehicle is genetically designed to operate on all levels. Strategy
accesses the unique ways energy is designed to flow through each person's BodyGraph, and ultimately
determines the way our health, sexuality, relationships, and life purpose play out.

All chart analysis begins at the level of Type. Each Type has a simple, understandable Strategy for
efficiently and successfully interacting aurically with the other Types. The Human Design Mandala
and BodyGraph provide the specific cosmic backdrop and blueprint, respectively, for determining
this Strategy. Once you begin living your Type’s Strategy, you will experience its rewards as your
‘Type’s signature: as peace (Manifestor), satisfaction (Generator), success (Projector), or as surprise
(Reflector). You will discover something inside of you that was hidden by overlays of conditioning.
You will get in touch with the part of you that always knew what was correct or not correct for
you; that place inside that you can trust to say yes or no to whatever you meet in this life. Strategy
breaks through the habit of comparing yourself to others, and opens the way for you to discover
your uniqueness so you can simply enjoy being who you are. Strategy frees your inner essence to
thrive so your purpose can naturally unfold. Living life according to your Strategy launches your
individual experiment. You can test your Strategy yourself and find out if it works for you. Let your
own Strategy and Authority begin to replace the blind faith that most of us place in any and all
authorities outside of ourselves.

STRATEGY: TO INFORM

SIGNATURE: PEACE

THE MANIFESTOR TYPE

Two things in particular distinguish a Manifestor’s design from the other Types. First, it conspicuously
lacks Sacral definition, which immediately places Manifestors in a global minority. Second, there
is either a direct or indirect connection between the Throat Center and one or more of the three
remaining motors in the BodyGraph: the Heart, Solar Plexus and Root Centers.

Manifestors are somewhat rare, comprising less than 10 percent of the world’s population.
OVERVIEW

‘The saga of humankind unfolded as it did because Manifestors didn’t have to wait for the ‘gods’
or for forces outside themselves to move them into action. Manifestors’ exceptional ability to
bring into being or make manifest what they envision, in combination with the protection of
their closed and repelling aura, often placed them in positions of rulership such as a warrior king
or high priest. As the only pure doers among the Types, Manifestors conquered and defended
kingdoms, and secured and maintained their power and authority by establishing the laws. Our
remaining religious and secular hierarchies are a result of the Manifestor’s attempt to retain
control and to avoid being challenged.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 7

The traditional ruler’s role that Manifestors held for centuries ended around 1781, however, when
humans transitioned from the 7-centered to the 9-centered form. Today’s Manifestors, still the
instruments of the yang/yang principle (primal force), are now living in a yin/yin (receptive)
Generator-dominated environment. Instead of dreaming empires into being or determining the
course of civilizations, they are now looking for a way to integrate their inherent independence, and
unique essential power to impact, into a society that has stripped away their freedom to act.

In today’s world the Manifestor’s incredible gifts are their ability to act independently, to initiate
action, and to impact others. When perceived as threatening or unpredictable, however, these same
qualities can make the other three Types uncomfortable, and often lead to overt attempts to control
the Manifestor. Manifestors are at ease with solitude, and find a nourishing peace in manifesting
what they want for themselves. This is their natural way and they don't require outside assistance.
‘They can't understand why others would even care about what they do, much less want to resist or
control them, but try to control they do — from parents on up. An early and unpleasant history of
conditioning experiences, mixed with resistance, pushes the Manifestor toward its not-self theme
of anger. This anger will be expressed in one of two ways: as anger/rage and rebelliousness, or as
passivity and accommodation. Both expressions repress the power of Manifestors and keep them
from realizing their worth, which is why Strategy is so important. By informing, and thus relaxing
the resistance met from others, Manifestors find what they seek most in life — the peace to do what
they want, when they want to do it.

Manifestors are not particularly interested in themselves, nor do they need to rely on other people
to ask them or invite them in order to act on their Authority. They are self-contained, independent
agents. They tend to see others as rather alien, behind the times, and stuck or unable to move
themselves out of predicaments. With their ability to glimpse the future, Manifestors often feel as
if they are waiting for everyone else to catch up.

‘The questions Manifestors ask are, “Will I be answered? Will someone be enlivened by my impact,
or respond to my initiating question?” This underlying pressure to impact, to make things happen,
is key to fulfilling their purpose. Manifestors are most comfortable when left alone to do as they
please, yet the other three Types are waiting for the Manifestor to initiate them, or a new process,
so each can contribute their essential part. Manifestors often look to the other Types to provide the
specific energy needed to complete what they themselves dream. In a perfect world, Manifestors get
things started; Projectors guide the process; Generators provide the energy to realize or complete it;
and Reflectors tell them how well it is going.

MANIFESTOR STRATEGY: TO INFORM

Manifestors have a long-standing reputation of posing a threat to order and stability. Their
independence and closed, repelling aura, which literally pushes their energy outward, is often
experienced (and misinterpreted) by others as the Manifestor’s need to take control or be in charge
of the situation. People often feel ignored or run over by ‘out of control’ Manifestors and tend,
therefore, to fear them. Conversely, Manifestors grow up conditioned by the fear of being controlled,
and rebel by doing the opposite of what is healthy for them. The Manifestor’s repelling aura causes
118 __THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

other auras to contract, putting them in a defensive or protective mode. Most interpersonal confusion
or misunderstanding between Types is set up energetically, far below one’s level of consciousness,
before verbal communication is even initiated.

‘The Manifestor’s simple strategy — to inform — breaks through this highly charged auric interaction,
and effectively opens the way to clear, productive and peaceful communication. Informing is
the only way Manifestors find the freedom from resistance that they need in order to manifest.
Technically, Manifestors need to inform after they have made a decision but before they act on it,
or at least as they are acting on it. Additionally, when they decide not to do something any longer,
they must inform about that too.

‘Though informing is far from pleasant and natural for a Manifestor, life is so much easier when they
learn to do it, and do it well. It is only by informing that they remove resistance from their path, and
put others at ease aurically, without being either passive or aggressive. As a child, informing takes the
form of learning politeness and asking permission. From an early age, however, Manifestors often
choose not to ask permission or inform, either because it is too much bother, or because they think
that by keeping what they are going to do a secret they can avoid being rejected and controlled.

Informing becomes an acceptable, practical part of the decision-making process when Manifestors
understand and embrace the impact they have on others. Manifestors do not need people in the
same way the other Types do, and are generally not concerned about how others perceive them.
‘They are generally genuinely surprised to learn that they have an impact at all. Becoming aware
of the many ways their impending decision will affect others is the first step to bridging relations,
and releasing their full initiating power. As Manifestors learn to inform before they act, to prepare
people for how they might be affected by their actions, they will begin to feel a new kind of support
and receptivity from others. When resistance is no longer an issue, anger subsides and peace prevails.
And Manifestors also feel honored and respected when others include and inform them.

To put informing and impact into perspective, let’s say a Manifestor goes to work and mid-
morning suddenly begins to see a way out of what had begun to feel like a dead-end job. In a
flurry of excitement, and with her vision leading her, she packs up her office, places a brief letter
of resignation in the boss’s mail box, says goodbye, wishes everyone well and walks out. Everyone
else then experiences what feels like chaos because they were not properly informed or prepared
for the action of the Manifestor. The boss is left without help, the Manifestor’s fellow employees
wonder what they did to offend, and the Manifestor’s family is concerned about the security of their
future. The impact of the Manifestor’s unanticipated action will most likely meet with some form of
resistance from those whose lives were affected by its abruptness.

The Manifestor had a plan of action, and did not need anyone else’s advice or input to make it
happen. Remembering to inform all of those who would be impacted by the decision, however,
would not only have reduced resistance, but also may have garnered the support needed to
achieve the new vision in peace. Informing paves the way for manifesting; it is the only solution
for the Manifestor.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 119

‘This strategy seems both logical and simple, and yet, most Manifestors think of themselves as alone
in the world, and informing is the last thing that naturally comes to mind. When they take the
time to write down the names of all the people their future decision might affect, they will usually
see that they are not isolated and their decisions do have impact. When Manifestors are aware of
how they impact, the logic of informing becomes apparent, and this knowledge alone can transform
them. In the end, informing is about showing respect for the other. When Manifestors don't inform,
others feel disrespected and ignored, whereas, informing dispels fear and builds trust which in turn
dissolves the need for control on either side.

THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORITY

In truth, as compared with the other Types for whom Strategy is a mechanical part of their design,
Manifestors have their Strategy artificially imposed on them as a means of eliminating or alleviating
resistance. Honoring their own Authority, therefore, becomes even more significant in their lives. To
attain the full expression of their cognitive potential, and to have the proper impact, they must act
out of their inner truth, and not from the mind. If they make up something to do using their mind,
just to release the pressure to get things moving, they will meet with resistance.

MANIFESTORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY

As true initiators, the timing of Manifestor’s actions are of utmost importance to them, especially
Manifestors with a defined Solar Plexus Center. Neither their truth nor their moment of clarity
can be accessed in an instant. Emotionally defined Manifestors who don’t wait out their emotional
wave are more reactive or impulsive, consequently, they meet with more resistance and tend to get
into trouble. By honoring and accepting the chemistry of their emotional wave, they can use their
waiting time beneficially to determine who will be impacted by their decision. Time brings clarity.
By the time they get to the end of their wave, and have reviewed the list of those most impacted,
they may decide to not even take action. Emotional authority requires that Manifestors nurture
patience in themselves, which can result in a win/win position for everyone.

‘There is a big difference between actions directed by the mind, and manifesting coming from a
place of inner clarity. If Manifestors feel an exaggerated urgency to act or implement their idea,
that impulse is usually not coming from their Authority, but rather from the amplified conditioning
of an open center expressing through their mind. Sometimes waiting can feel like an excruciating
punishment to emotionally defined Manifestors, but it keeps them from acting too quickly and
suffering unwelcome and avoidable consequences.

If Manifestors wait through the movement of their wave, they will notice one of two things. Either
the feeling of wanting to act has subsided, meaning it was not meant to be, or they still feel they
want to make that decision or take that action, and they will when the time feels right. There is no
longer a sense of urgency or pressure connected to the decision. Everything can happen naturally
when they observe their wave, and inform as they prepare to act. This is the only way emotional
Manifestors can reach their goal of living as themselves in peace.
120 : __THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

MANIFESTORS WITH SPLENIC AUTHORITY

Unlike the emotionally defined Manifestor’s need to be patient and wait for clarity, the action
and initiating of the Manifestor with Splenic authority flows out instinctively and naturally in
the moment. Such spontaneity, although freeing, creates the dilemma of having to inform when
one has only an inkling of the impact that the immediate decision or action might have. It takes a
firm intention on the part of the Manifestor to live closely attuned to Splenic Authority, and still
effectively inform. For example, if a Manifestor takes that first step into a restaurant with friends and
his body stops him, he has no choice but to pay attention to it. Though it is obviously not healthy for
him to enter, his Splenic alert did not come with an explanation. All he can do is honestly inform
his companions of what action is correct for him right now, and be aware of how his sudden decision
impacts everyone’s plans.

MANIFESTORS IN RELATIONSHIPS

Despite the fact that they are perfectly capable of great love and devotion for their families, it’s
not easy for an independent loners like Manifestors to be in relationship. Their closed auras do
not naturally embrace or take in others. Neither are they penetrable, which means others cannot
easily get to know a Manifestor well. This is particularly difficult for a mother or lover because it
can create confusing barriers to intimacy. Understanding how Strategy opens the way to clearer
auric interaction between Types allows for genuine compassion, and helps to ameliorate any pain
associated with misunderstanding the differences.

Additionally, whether male or female, Manifestors have to do the initiating to be correct. For
example, if a Manifestor likes somebody, it is proper for them to make the first move instead of
hoping they'll be noticed and approached. They need to take the initiative, to pursue the person and
let them know what they feel, and what they want or envision. It’s a risky business and makes them
acutely vulnerable to rejection. Being a Manifestor, though, is about breaking free from the safe
routines of tradition. The fears this freedom raises in the Manifestor must be faced and overcome in
order to move forward. Just because they are loners doesn't mean Manifestors don't truly desire, or
can't have, warmth and companionship and long-term associations.

A peaceful relationship for the Manifestor is based on practicing politeness and informing. They
cannot walk out of the house without telling their partner where they are going as this will only
create resistance upon their return. “Where have you been?” the partner will ask. “What did you
do? Why didn't you tell me?” To avoid the interrogation, all the Manifestor needs to do is inform.
“I'm going to the store and T’ll be right back.” The partner of a Manifestor often perceives the
Manifestor’s independence as a silent but effective ‘do not disturb’ sign — which isn’t true. Manifestors
feel respected when others also keep them informed. Reciprocal informing dissolves much of the
resistance, eliminates the anger, and enhances mutual respect between partners in a relationship.
You can't tell Manifestors what to do, or ask them like you would a Generator, or invite them like a
Projector. If you inform them, however, “We are out of coffee,” their Authority will guide them to
act on it, if it is appropriate and correct for them to do so.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 121

MANIFESTOR CHILDREN

Perhaps Manifestor children are misunderstood because they are now so rare. Their strong, repelling
auras are felt the moment they come into the world, putting their parents immediately on the alert.
Even as children, though, they need to be respected and treated as Manifestors, and given a healthy
amount of freedom of movement. It is essential to teach them their Strategy early on, for when
they are polite and ask permission, they will more often than not be allowed to do what they want
to, except when safety is an issue for them or anyone else impacted. Putting excessive controls on
Manifestor children forces them to rebel or become passive.

MANIFESTORS AND THE EFFECTS
OF LIVING FROM THE NOT-SELF

Manifestors living and making mental decisions or decisions from their not-self meet a lot of
resistance, and may see themselves as victims of control and punishment. They do not experience
their inherent power, but instead feel restricted and powerless. These are deep sources for most
Manifestors’ anger, which may become depression or despair if turned inward on themselves. “Life is
so unfair!” To avoid being controlled or rejected, not-self Manifestors tend to relinquish their power,
pretending they are not powerful. They behave like Generators by waiting rather than initiating,
responding to what others want from them. They become impulsive workaholics but end up
accomplishing little. Their timing is completely off as they aggressively initiate but refuse to inform,
generally crashing through things and creating all sorts of resistance in their lives. In these ways,
powerlessness replaces their authentic power. The overall result is exhaustion and ineffectiveness.

What they forget is that they are still Manifestors, and for anything of value to happen in a
Manifestor’s life, it is the Manifestor who has to initiate it — including reconnecting to their own
life, to their own Authority. They are here to have an impact!

When Manifestors enter their experiment of following their Strategy to inform, and relying on
their Authority for decisions, they will have to confront the following fears in order to succeed:

+ Fear of upsetting someone

+ Fear of informing because it might cause confrontation

+ Fear of informing because someone will try to control them

+ Fear of informing because they might meet resistance or rejection
+ Fear of one’s own anger

HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR MANIFESTORS

It is best for Manifestors, with their open Sacral Center, to go to bed before they feel totally
exhausted. By lying down or relaxing as much as an hour before they would like to be asleep, they
give their bodies a chance to unwind. Additionally, their auras have time to release energies that
do not belong to them, thus preparing them for a peaceful, refreshing night's rest.
122 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

SIGNATURE GOAL: PEACE

What Manifestors desire more than anything else is peace; a place of no resistance. Breaking away
from living a not-self life is what opens the way to that peace. This means dreaming and pursuing
their visions, doing what they want to do and are here to do, out of a deep sense of calmness and
inner stillness. When they find themselves in this state of peace, they know they are aligned to their
Authority by their Strategy of informing, and are empowered to manifest and have their unique and
essential impact on the world.

THE GENERATOR TYPE

Unique to, and of central importance for, Generators is their Sacral Center which both cradles
and generates the pattern of life on the planet. When the Sacral Center is defined in a chart, the
person is either a pure Generator or a Manifesting Generator. What distinguishes them is that
a pure Generator has a defined Sacral Center without a motor connected directly to the Throat,
and a Manifesting Generator has a defined Sacral with a motor connected to the Throat. The
Manifesting Generator is not a separate Type, but rather a variation of the Generator Type, with a
subtle distinction that lies in its auric frequency. Manifesting Generators are Generators by Type,
and are designed to follow the Generator Strategy — to respond.

As approximately 70 percent of all people are Sacrally defined, the Generator’s creative life-force
energy dominates the global frequency of the planet. Pure Generators comprise approximately 37
percent of humanity, and Manifesting Generators about 33 percent.

OVERVIEW

Throughout human history, the creative energy and stamina of Generators made them a valuable
and desirable commodity. At the same time, ignorance of their own potential made them easy prey
for those who could take advantage of their gifts. Generators have always been deeply envious
124 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

of the ability of Manifestor’s to manifest what they envision. Unable to mimic or compete with
Manifestors without meeting resistance and failure, they grudgingly surrendered to the Manifestor
who ultimately enslaved or controlled them to erect huge empires. Generators became forced
laborers, the great builders of our civilizations.

‘They retain the role of builder to this day, although they now have the tools at their disposal to
live this role awake and aware, free of oppression, and with full knowledge of their incredible
Sacral potential. They can know exactly what they are here to do, and love doing it — in cooperative
and mutually beneficial ways with the other three Types. This new phase of understanding and
appreciating their place in the whole is slowly evolving. It will be a reality when Generators relax
into responding, when Manifestors initiate, when Projectors guide and when Reflectors reflect the
level of satisfaction and authenticity in the world.

All Generators are born to work and to love the work they do, completely exhausting their measure of
creative Sacral energy every day. Their Sacral motor doesn't give up until what it has committed to is
accomplished. This is what brings deep satisfaction with life and a restful, regenerating night’s sleep.
‘The other three Types are looking outward — the Manifestor is focused on impacting, the Projector
on knowing about how other Types use their energy resources, and the Reflector on understanding
the environment. Generators, however, are focused on knowing themselves and understanding their
own process. Generators find their life through their work, through how they respond to using
their daily supply of energy. The right work actually transforms their life and slows the degenerative
process of their bodies.

Generators are designed to respond with their Sacral Center through sounds, as a vibration that rises
to their throat from their midsection (pure Generators), or as actual movement toward engaging
in the activity (more common to Manifesting Generators). Responses are based on the availability
of their Sacral energy to do what they have been asked. Once pure Generators respond, and are
engaged in an activity, they go through a step-by-step process which thoroughly covers each stage of
its development. They have no motor connected to the Throat Center, and will hit plateaus of energy
along the way. At each of these stuck points, they need to be initiated again by new input, insight, or
further instructions so they can respond. In order to avoid the temptation to quit when they reach
these moments of transition, their Sacral must be committed to the process from the beginning. The
gift of pure Generators is to demonstrate their ability to perfect or master a task or project or skill.

In contrast, Manifesting Generators have a motor connected to the Throat, which enables them
to move quickly from response to manifestation. This allows them to see which steps are essential
and which steps can be skipped, resulting in the gift of efficiency. This same efficiency creates a
dilemma for them, however, which is a tendency to be so impatient and move through a task
so fast that they miss steps. They often have to go back and complete those steps which creates
frustration. This frustration can be avoided, and efficiency increased, by slowing down enough to
pay more attention to their responses as the process unfolds. Manifesting Generators are more
prone to impatience and aggression than pure Generators. Because of the motor connection
to their Throat Center, they tend to bypass their sacral sounds. It often takes the Manifesting
Generator more practice and patience to re-establish a connection to and trust in their Sacral.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 125

GENERATOR STRATEGY: TO RESPOND

“LIKE THE PRIESTESSES OF DELPHI, YOU HAVE TO ASK GENERATORS;
OTHERWISE YOU GET NOTHING.” — RA URU HU

All Generators have embracing auras that transmit the creative/creating life force of their Sacral
Center, and establish an energy field of ‘availability’ around them. In order to access their enormous
wealth of energy and power, one must ask for it so the Generator’s Sacral Center can respond.
Generators must wait until something comes toward them, so that their Sacral can either fully
embrace it or remain closed to it. A Sacral ‘ah-huh’ carries enough energy to complete the task or
honor the request, while an ‘uhn-ub ‘is a ‘no’ and warns against committing to it.

This kind of clear, objective, honest, moment-to-moment mechanical response connects
Generators directly to their own truth, revealing who they are, and what they love and value.
Emanating through their aura, the persevering power of their creative life force draws others to
them like a magnet, while their Sacral response sets clear personal boundaries. For Generators,
life is renewed with each response because each decision moves them along their path toward the
perfection of their unique potential.

Generators often misinterpret or equate ‘waiting to respond’ with ‘doing nothing.’ It is impossible
for them to do nothing because they are constantly busy generating. If they are doing the work they
love, or if they retreat from a dog’s growl, or smile when a bird sings, or hum along with a tune,
or enter a conversation when asked, they are living in response. Generators are designed to wait,
trusting that life will come to them. They simply respond from the moment they get out of bed in
the morning until they fall back into bed at night. A revolution of Generators living completely
through response could change the frequency on the planet from frustration to satisfaction. This is
why the Generator’s mystical path and contribution to humanity is to wake up their Sacral, and to
live surrendered to its subjective truth.

It is helpful for the other three Types to understand that once a Generator has committed to a task
or a direction, they cannot quickly change gears. To a Manifestor, the Generator feels slow and
ponderous, and a Projector offering guidance may feel like the Generator is not listening. Only by
being asked again, so they can respond, are Generators able to disconnect from where they are in the
moment, and reconnect to something different. When asked so they can respond, there is a clearer,
more straightforward, and productive exchange between Types. Learning to ask Generators good
‘yes or no’ questions makes all the difference.

Half of the battle for Generators is accepting the fact that they cannot manifest their ideas for their
own life. They need to give up any pictures that their minds have about what their life ‘should look
like.’ Desires and fantasies, usually based on comparisons coming through their open centers, push
them into actions intended to force those dreams into reality. Such initiating merely meets with
resistance, however, not satisfaction. Frustration is the guidepost that reminds Generators to return
to their own one-of-a-kind responsive life.
126 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

The following narrative about a Generator and a Manifestor illustrates the difference between
responding and initiating. You will recognize their Strategy by the roles they play. The setting is a
dusty western town, and sitting in front of his office is the sheriff. The townspeople are in an uproar
because they have heard that a gunslinger is on his way to town. Everyone tries to get the sheriff to
move, to do something to protect them. The sheriff just sits and waits. The gunslinger arrives in town,
dismounts, walks into the middle of the street and informs the sheriff of his intentions. The sheriff
responds and steps away from his office and into the street to face him. The gunslinger draws his gun
and the sheriff, empowered by waiting, shoots him dead. The moral of the story is that Generators
who wait until they are fully empowered and perfectly clear in their response, will find their actions
are well-timed — and right on target.

GENERATORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY

Emotional Authority adds another dimension to the waiting game for Generators. Their warm,
passionate energy has enormous value to others, which gives their waiting a subtle element of
seduction, and allows Generators to shape the outcome of an offer on their own terms. No one
has the right to gain immediate access to their energy. They become their own worst enemy if they
succumb to impatience by hurrying the process, initiating, accepting less than they should have, or
jumping into a commitment prematurely. A few handy phrases that give them time to wait out their
wave while leaving doors open to their availability are, “It is a good offer, but I would like to sleep on
it. It is a lot to consider; may I have some time to think about it?” A non-emotionally defined person
might take this as a rejection of the proposal, but if it is correct for both parties, their auras will pull
them back together even stronger for having gone through the process properly.

Emotional definition need not be a frustrating detour to living. For Generators, following their
emotional wave reveals new perspectives on a decision or situation at each point along the way. Very
often the first response is correct, but waiting for clarity allows them to make sure that there is time
to uncover all the important things that would otherwise be missed. And sometimes the ‘yes’ ends
up being a ‘no’ once they have time to see all the information and details that only waiting reveals.
Staying with the wave as it cycles, and not rushing into decisions, adds depth to one’s life. In order
to appreciate this process as it unfolds, however, all involved must be patient.

GENERATORS IN RELATIONSHIPS

To the casual observer, two Generators making a decision in relationship can appear both awkward and
hilarious. She might express an idea or possibility and ask him for his response. Since the idea came
from her head as a thought, however, instead of from her Sacral, he then has to ask her if it is something
she really wants to do after all. If her sacral says ‘uhn-uh’, they start all over again, either by refining the
original idea or testing a new one. This is the way Generators determine what will ultimately bring the
pleasure and satisfaction they seek with each other, in both business and interpersonal relationships. If
Generators begin a relationship correctly, they will end it correctly, and leave without blame or guilt.
If they don't enter it correctly, they can’t leave it correctly, and they may carry a wound inside that can
take seven years to resolve. This wound can negatively condition all future relationships. The secret to
success is for Generators to begin and build relationships as themselves, through response.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN _127

GENERATOR CHILDREN

When Generator children answer with their Sacral voice of ah huh or uhn-uh, they are often told
this is not polite. They are forced to stop making sounds and to speak with words and sentences
instead. When this happens, the doorway to their Sacral truth closes, and they are cut off from
developing self-esteem and self-love. Parents must learn to respect and encourage the Sacral sounds
of their children. Generator children are designed to be busy and active until their Sacral energy is
used up, and they fall into bed exhausted. Forcing them to take naps before they are tired will meet
resistance and frustration on both sides. Aware and understanding parents can develop sensitivity to
the energy and inner rhythms of their Generator child.

RECOGNIZING NOT-SELF GENERATOR BEHAVIORS

Generators living as Manifestors are easily recognized by their frustrated, unfulfilled state of being.
From childhood on, Generators have been told to “go out there and make it happen.” When
Generators initiate, however, the energy gets stuck and can't move forward. To compensate, the
mind pushes them on ahead or becomes attached to the outcomes they think they want. Instead of
finding satisfaction, they can’t even finish what they start. They end up exhausting their energy with
no satisfaction, their work has no meaning, and their relationships don’t measure up or bring them
pleasure — life doesn’t work for them. This scenario is also why they are great quitters, and yet, the
last thing that occurs to them is to wait to respond.

Many Generators have been conditioned since birth to suppress or deny their primal sounds, and
instead rely on the mind’s open center not-self commentaries to guide them. Generators have
become comfortable living their unfulfilling not-self lives, which makes it difficult for them to now
revive or reconnect to their Sacral response. They are fearful of the possibility that they may not be
able to hear their response, as well as fearful of the change response might bring. They have no real
idea what life lived as their true self may be like. After years of practicing vegetarianism, for instance,
they might hear their Sacral respond ah huh to a steak!

Generators need to know that there is a time for everything if they wait, and that they can respond
to anything as long as it is coming toward them. For example, their minds can’t determine what
they want to eat. They need to be asked or to hear what is on the menu so they can respond. This is
especially important for beginners. Asking themselves questions, talking to themselves in the mirror
or responding to questions they have written down, is not the same as responding to something
coming toward them from the outside. These shortcuts will not bring Generators to their inner
truth. To be effective, another person is needed to ask the clarifying questions.

The underlying question for a Generator is “Will I be Asked?” Or, “If I wait to be asked, will
anything ever happen?” Understanding the beauty of their open and enveloping aura, which is
designed to draw the question from others, allows them to watch and wait — and relax into living.
128 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

As Generators begin to honor their strategy they will have to deal with mental fears such as:

Fear that no one will ask them or that they will have nothing to respond to.

Fear of the unknown.

Fear that nothing will happen in their life or that their survival will be in jeopardy.
Fear of losing control over their life.

Fear of failure.

HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR GENERATORS

For Generators, true rest will not come until they have finished generating and burned off that day’s
energy. When they do fall into bed exhausted, they will sleep better and feel fresh and new in the
morning. Manifesting Generators should get into bed before they are exhausted however, and work,
read or watch television until they are finished generating. They need to allow their energy to calm
down, and yet still continue to move them to a point of exhaustion.

SIGNATURE GOAL: SATISFACTION

What Generators seek most in life is satisfaction. Their minds will never figure out what brings them
that kind of deep satisfaction, yet response brings it with ease. There is nothing more rewarding for
Generators than to feel a sense of satisfaction in their work, and in their relationships.

THE PROJECTOR /\

FOCUSED AND ABSORBING AURA

NoOT-SELF THEME: BI

STRATEGY: WAITING
FOR THE INVITATION

SIGNATURE: SUCCESS

THE PROJECTOR TYPE

‘Two things stand out in a Projector’s BodyGraph. The first is an undefined Sacral Center, and the
second is that there is no motor connection with the Throat Center, meaning Projectors have no
built-in potential for generating or manifesting. Because they possess no consistent, reliable means of
manifesting or generating energy, Projectors are classified with Reflectors as a non-energy type. These
two Types use their experiential wisdom about energy to increase the understanding and productivity
of the energy types (Generators and Manifestors). Projector’s charts can be configured with as few as
two and as many as eight defined centers. They make up approximately 21 percent of the population.

OVERVIEW

Projectors represent a new energy archetype on the planet that emerged after 1781. Until the advent
of The Human Design System, Projectors had no direct means by which to fully comprehend either
their unique auric field, or the particular role they are here to play as one of the four Types. Up
until the last century, Manifestors and Generators dominated positions of leadership and authority
around the world. In the future, however, it is the Projector who will begin to move into positions
of greater power, taking leadership itself in a new direction. This will happen when the energy types
recognize and empower the Projector’s natural potential by inviting the Projector to guide them. As
Manifestors are freed to initiate processes, and Generators begin to realign with their own natural
power as creative builders, Projectors will emerge as the administrators of the new order.
130__ THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The Projectors’focused, probing aura, and complex way of interacting with people at deeper energetic
levels, sets them apart from the other three Types. With their natural brilliance and openness to
taking on the expectations and energies of others, however, they have managed to effectively imitate
both Manifestors and Generators, and lose themselves in the process. How Projectors reclaim that
self, along with their significant and rightful place in the whole, begins with a comprehensive look
at the complex nature of their unique configuration.

Projectors have a general openness to life, combined with an aura that penetrates the energy of
others so they can absorb it, and energetically taste it. With their capacity to see the big picture,
recognize the talents and gifts of others, and bring people together, they make exceptional advisors,
administrators, networkers and natural mediators. Projectors can be gifted organizers, and masters
at understanding how to maximize energy and resources as they see things that others often miss.
Just because Projectors can see how a person's energy is best utilized, however, doesn’t mean they
can tell others what to do. A specific part of their role and purpose here on earth is to guide others
by knowing how to ask the right questions. Projectors have a natural gift for diplomacy that is wise
to nurture.

Projectors are rising naturally to the top of the Type hierarchy, however, they still have a long way to
go, and a great deal depends on having awake and aware Manifestor and Generator energy to work
with. Projectors are more interested in other people’s designs than they are in their own, and they
normally seek out systems that help them to understand individuals, groups and the ways people
work together more efficiently and effectively.

Recognition is the Projector’s key to understanding the way their Strategy connects them to
their Authority and the world. In some ways, recognition is to Projectors what responding is
to Generators. Their powers of strategic recognition provide them with their boundaries, which
they maintain by being selective when accepting invitations. Both the Projector’s ability to
recognize what is available to them from others, and the need for their own unique gifts to be
properly recognized by others, are part of the specific way their auras are designed to connect. The
Projector aura is an ]-am-open-to-an-invitation field that draws people in and out of their lives
by provoking invitations from them. Recognition, accompanied by a formal invitation, is the way
the other Types honor and empower Projectors.

As with Generators, waiting is a quality of the Projector’s Strategy, however the clarity of
their answer is not as immediately accessible as a Sacral response. To further analyze these
subtle differences, we have divided Projectors into three basic categories based on the chart
configurations illustrated on the following page.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 131

o-G

THE THREE CATEGORIES OF PROJECTORS

MENTAL PROJECTORS

Mental Projectors are defined by any combination of defined Head, Ajna, and
‘Throat Centers, but have no definition below the Throat Center. They have an
open design and a deep reliance on their mind. They tap into their environment
and read its transient energies through all of their undefined Centers. Mental
Projectors are the archetype of Outer Authority, which is to say one who provides
valued information and guidance for others, and it is difficult for them to accept
the fact that their strong and agile minds cannot be their personal Authority. For
Mental Projectors to reach clarity in decision-making, it is helpful to bounce

things off others so they can hear it themselves. Their surroundings can have a definite influence on
their decision-making process, so it is also important that they get a sense of how the environment
is affecting them. With so much of their design open and vulnerable to conditioning, understanding
how others impact them can prove an invaluable tool. Through studying other people’s designs, Mental
Projectors begin to understand the similarities and differences in their own process. As they become
awake and aware, their own strategy begins to work for them.

ENERGY PROJECTORS

Energy Projectors have one or more motors, except the Sacral Center, defined in
their design. They need to pay close attention to the guidance of their Authority,
being extra vigilant for invitations from people who want access to their energy
just to fill a vacant position or get a job done. Even though these Projectors
are under pressure to discharge built-up energy from the motors defined, it is
essential they expend it either by doing something they enjoy, or by doing what
they have been recognized for and properly invited to do. This extra energy creates
two temptations for Projectors. The first is initiating an action just to release the

7
Vv,
Na

pressure. The second is unwittingly committing to an activity whereby they become a laborer, rather
than the one who can see how to direct a process towards greater efficiency and success.

CLASSIC PROJECTORS

Classic Projectors have definition below the Throat Center, that does not include a
motor. Without motor definition in their design, they can test or taste the fuel from
the motors of others, and discern which people are correct for them and which are
not. This gives them the potential to be more objective and more selective about the
invitations they accept. For example, Projectors take in, experience and magnify the
creative life force energy of a defined Sacral Center. This can be exhilarating, but
can also make them prone to any toxic or detrimental frequencies attached to that
energy. It’s like ingesting a poison which then smothers or destroys their vitality,

and compromises their physical or mental health. Since all Projector decisions connect them to energies
which either empower or enslave them, becoming conscious of the purity of the fuel emanating from
people they accept into their lives is critical to their overall well-being.
132 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

ALL PROJECTORS

‘The dilemma for all Projectors is waiting for the invitation. They want to be, and must be, recognized
and invited in order to fulfill their purpose as administrators and guides. Personal success for
Projectors is dependent on having energetically healthy people aournd them who acknowledge
their Projector skills, and offer them their energy resources to work with.

When not-self Projectors, eager for recognition of any kind, try to meet the expectations of
others and thus are recognized instead for who they are ‘not’, they can get confused and attach
themselves to anyone, even someone who is detrimental to them. Healthy Projectors are those
who avoid this trap by recognizing themselves, and understanding their own limitations. When
they are no longer dependent on external sources for affirmation of any kind, the true Projector
gift of recognition is returned to its rightful and properly functioning place in their Strategy.

‘The most basic but essential function of recognition for Projectors relates to choosing people to be
in their inner circle, people who will keep them aligned with their own path and purpose. Because
Projectors are designed to penetrate other’s centers so deeply, and because they cannot fulfill their
purpose without access to the energy and resources of other people, Projectors need to know who is
right for them; who recognizes or sees them for who they truly are.

‘This applies to the ways they connect to the wider community as well. For example, if you are
a skilled classical guitarist, you wouldn't book a concert to entertain a crowd expecting to dance
to rock n’ roll, unless your personal gifts include converting the casual listener to classical guitar
music and you have been invited to do just that. Without the invitation, you would be wasting your
precious Projector gifts and leave the place without recognition, embittered by the experience. No
amount of money could buy or replace what you would lose.

Nothing boosts the mood of Projectors like being recognized, or drops them faster into a state of
bitterness when they are not. When Projectors try to get others to see them, they are perceived as
needy and demanding. Other Types feel this ‘need’ for recognition and resist it. By initiating and
inviting themselves, Projectors are giving their inherent power to the other person, which places
them at a huge disadvantage. This often happens in family relationships where they have not been
seen as themselves from the beginning. Taking their power back is difficult at first; it involves shifting
their focus, standing securely grounded in awareness of their own gifts, and waiting until their own
auric message is clearly received. This allows the people around them to recognize and invite their
real gifts into the relationship, and changes the basis for the relationship as a whole.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 133

PROJECTOR STRATEGY: RECOGNITION,
To WAIT FOR THE INVITATION

Projectors are designed to be seen. They are always being noticed, but one must question what is really
getting the attention. Are they being recognized for their true gifts or not? When Projectors are truly
recognized, they feel it in their core and there is no doubt. The Projector Strategy and decision-making
process is to wait for the recognition, and then the invitation. Recognition and invitations come from
silence. When Projectors grasp that waiting quietly is a quality of readiness, they can watch their strong
aura pull people and recognition to them. Once they have been recognized and invited correctly, their
gifts and skills are empowered as they are filled up by a transient energy that is theirs to choreograph.
‘The energy they connect with and commit to managing sort of flows through them. It is not theirs, but
they get to utilize its potential to benefit others for as long as that invitation lasts.

Waiting for the invitation has specific qualities to it that are subtly different from the waiting
Strategy of Generators, who wait for their life to be directed from moment to moment through
response. Projectors are waiting for what is best described as a more formal, long-term invitation.
‘They are waiting for ‘investors’ to recognize, request and empower their special skills — in exchange
for ample compensation! That invitation offers the Projector access to the investor's initiating and
generating energy resources. This is what the Projector lives for, how their genius is empowered,
and how they will experience the success they are here to achieve in their lifetime. The relationship
between the Generator and Projector is both essential and interdependent, as neither has the power
to fulfill their purpose without the other.

Investor invitations generally, but not exclusively, apply to the four major decisions one makes in life
the invitation to love, to a career, to bond with others, and to a place to live. Once an invitation is
received and accepted, Projectors can use all the skills at their disposal, within the parameters set by
the invitation, for as long as the investor remains open and receptive and willing to play their part.
This can be for a few weeks, a few months, a few years, or for the rest of their life. When entering
into any of these major long-term commitments, Projectors need to be intentional and deliberate in
following their Strategy and Authority.

‘The next essential step for Projectors is being selective. Just because they finally received an invitation
doesn’t automatically make it right for them. Their Authority will guide them to the right energy
exchange for them. Each Projector’s decision-making process is unique, and the best way to determine
what a correct invitation looks like is to measure the level of resistance they meet when they act on
one. Over time, and with increased self awareness, the Projector’s proficiency at recognizing correct
invitations improves, and the process itself is refined. When Projectors are recognized and invited,
they suddenly have access to the reliable energy of others, which in turn releases their own Projector
gifts and outer authority. Patience and careful observation are once again key factors.

All invitations come with an expiration date. If the invitation has lost its energy or excitement, it
is possible that the invitation has been withdrawn, or perhaps the job is complete but no one has
noticed. The Projector may feel that things just aren't working anymore, such as money, interest,
support, or adequate time are no longer available. At this point, it is helpful to discuss the situation
134 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

with the investor in order to clarify the status of the invitation. Once aligned in their own power,
Projectors can let their auras do the talking. Their silent waiting is the most effective way to elicit
correct invitations from others. Gradually, the people and invitations that were not based on
recognition will slowly fall away. If Projectors trust in the silent magic of their chemistry, there is
no need to do the inviting themselves; opportunities will come to them.

When Projectors understand the sanctity of their aura, they will nurture and protect it. This begins
with creating an essentially aura-free space in their home they can retreat to in order to properly relax
and release the auric energies they have absorbed during the day. Sleeping alone is also important for
a Projector because 70 percent of the population is generating Sacral motor energy. In order to enter
a deep, restful sleep, Projectors must first take time to diffuse the extra energy they have taken in.
Achieving a healthy balance between activity and rest in their life begins with learning to sense when
enough is enough, when to let go of the residual auric energy of others, and when to be alone.

PROJECTORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY

Projectors have been waiting so long for invitations that even those with emotional definition have
a tendency to jump at the first opportunity. Unfortunately, what appears to be a great invitation
when they are up in their wave can turn into a horrible commitment when they are down in their
wave. We are all conditioned to be polite and answer spontaneously when someone invites us to
accept a job, or attend an event. It’s also easy for emotional Projectors to get hooked into someone
else’s energy field, which adds to the confusion. They need to wait, discuss it, wait, and discuss it yet
again. By waiting for clarity they may, in fact, receive an even more delicious invitation. The strategy
for emotional Projectors is simply to request a day or two to think it over. If they’re still not clear
by then, they should unashamedly ask for more time and/or clarification of the details. Part of the
experiment for them is to observe how and if their auric field draws the other person back again to
renew the invitation while they themselves are waiting for clarity.

PROJECTORS IN RELATIONSHIPS

For a relationship to work, Projectors must be recognized, formally invited into it, and given an
essential role in its unfolding. Projectors who are neither appreciated nor recognized are stuck in
a dependent and weak position, which leaves them feeling bitter. Life and relationships lose their
sweetness. The best advice, as with all types, is to enter relationships correctly from the beginning.

PROJECTOR CHILDREN

It is particularly important to the extremely sensitive Projector child that parents be intentional about
their own energy mechanics. Part of parental support includes recognizing ways the child manages
or interacts with healthy energies early on. Teaching Projector children to recognize themselves, to
know when they are recognized by others, and to recognize what a correct invitation feels like, places
them on the track to success. This is all the encouragement they need to practice their Strategy and
Authority, and appreciate their uniqueness as a Projector.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 135

Parents who invite and recognize their Projector children give them a chance to develop, express
and feel the power of being who they truly are. Children who are taught to recognize and wait for
the correct receptive audience grow up to be correct as adults, and when invited to do so, can express
their gifts with clarity and authenticity in the world.

Emotional Projector children must also be invited, but without any pressure being placed on them
to make a decision in the moment. This gives them a chance to get in touch with their emotional
wave. When they are in a community that recognizes them, they will grow and thrive. If they are
put under pressure to accept invitations or make decisions before they have a chance to process and
know what is right for them, they can easily end up confused, bitter and unsuccessful.

PROJECTOR RECOGNITION AND THE NOT-SELF

When Projector’s hear about their Type, there is an immediate resonance with the keyword ‘invitation.’
‘They suddenly realize that they have been the ones doing the inviting! In their restlessness and
insecurity, they treated others the way they themselves were meant to be treated, which naturally
met with resistance. After a lifetime of feeling unrecognized and uninvited, Projectors become
deeply pessimistic about people showing a genuine interest in them.

When Projectors feel starved for energy, they will compromise and settle for an invitation to the
wrong energy exchange. Accurate recognition and a proper invitation is what sets a Projector’ gifts
in motion and increases their value to others. For example, when someone says to an emotionally
defined Projector, “I love the way you process your decisions through your feelings,” they know the
person sees them. This gives the Projector access to clean energy and, potentially, a receptive ear for
their insightful guidance and advice.

Once a proper invitation is completed or withdrawn, the Projector’s job is complete. Because the
energy they were committed to managing is no longer available to them, however, their not-self may
panic and interfere with their letting go and moving on. Their not-self has no confidence in Strategy
or their Projector auric invitation field, which can lead to them holding onto people, not knowing
when enough is enough, trying to prove themselves, accepting a wrong invitation to begin with, or
being fearful of not being invited again.

It is through understanding others that Projectors arrive at a clear understanding of themselves. If
their agenda for reaching out to people comes with the expectation that they will get attention or
recognition, however, they will meet with resistance. Like all types, they need to be aware of their
underlying agenda and hidden expectations.

Projectors have a very strong intellect. They like to study and take in information. Because of this,
they tend to have a deeply conditioned mind that tries to control their lives and circumstances
through the not-self strategies of their open centers. They tend to feel they will not get the life they
really want, so they compromise in their relationships and jobs by settling for what they think they
can get. Settling is a huge problem for the Projector, especially when there are bills to pay.
136 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR PROJECTORS

It is best for Projectors, with their open Sacral Center, to go to bed before they feel totally exhausted.
By lying down or relaxing as much as an hour before they would like to be asleep, they give their
bodies a chance to unwind, and their auras time to release energies that do not belong to them, thus
preparing them for a peaceful, refreshing night’s rest.

SIGNATURE GOAL: SUCCESS

Success dispels bitterness and maximizes the Projector’s sense of well-being. Recognizing the
uniqueness and potential in others, and guiding them by asking the right questions without a personal
agenda, is the Projector gift. The right questions ultimately open the door to satori, transforming
and awakening someone to their own unique truth. Success also means getting to a place within
where being a non-energy type is no longer an issue. Waiting for a respectful, formal invitation,
accompanied by the appropriate rewards and energy resources, is the Projector’s Strategy for the big
decisions in life, thus reducing the likelihood of overexertion or mental and physical breakdown. By
moving from success to success, the Projector learns how to use their limited energy wisely.

THE REFLECTOR

SAMPLING AURA

STRATEGY: WAITING
A LUNAR CYCLE

SIGNATURE: SURPRISE

THE REFLECTOR TYPE

Reflector BodyGraphs are easy to identify because all nine centers remain white. Instead of a fixed
definition, Reflectors have gate activations. These gates form a channel when connected to a harmonic
gate courtesy of other people’s auras, or transiting celestial bodies. The unusual way Reflectors process
and experience energy, quite different from that of the other Types, means that Reflectors live by a
different set of rules. They are truly extraordinary in many ways, and make up approximately 1 percent
of the population.

OVERVIEW

Reflectors stand alone — totally unique in their perspective, quietly unobtrusive in their auric presence, and
extraordinary in their role. They are born with a special attunement to the cosmic environment, and to
the impact of the neutrino field on human beings. Like a canary in a coal mine, they sample, reflect and
judge the quality of the environment on any given day. Reflectors can be so attuned to the transit program
that they can also measure other's attunement to it. They sense who is living authentically, or who has
been conditioned by the transit field and become a victim of it. The more people allow their lives to be
conditioned by the transits, the farther away they are from fulfilling their unique potential. Reflectors
can tell who is ready to become their own authority. They sense or feel the physical, psychic or emotional
health of an environment, community or group, and they are here to judge what is working correctly or
not. As people become awake and aware, Reflectors are there, ready to objectively share or reflect what
they have sampled. This process is how the Reflector moves to the center and becomes ‘visible.’
138 - THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Reflectors are here to enliven and lift up the energy of others. In a rather extraordinary way, Reflectors
can amplify and reflect or mirror other people’s energy back to them. It is a unique aptitude which
facilitates an experience of heightened awareness in terms of what they see in the other, yet in a
non-judgemental way. The unimposing, non-intrusive nature of their auric presence also makes
Reflectors particularly effective facilitators of the group process. All of this remains only a potential
for Reflectors, however, until they are able to operate as themselves, rather than an amplified version
of the homogenized world around them.

Many of the characteristics that differentiate Reflectors today resonate from a time when our earliest
human ancestors lived in harmony with the cosmos, in flow with nature, and in community with
each other. Over the eons, their ways of surviving within the natural flow were systemically replaced
by the aggressive, strategic ways of evolving mental awareness. Once mental superiority was in place,
hierarchies arose based on dominance, and unimposing, gentle Reflectors were not among them.

A new natural hierarchy is beginning to emerge, however, in which Reflectors will play an exquisite
role as they stand for ultimate justice. With their quiet, unobtrusive aura, they will fill their rightful
place at the center of the Type hierarchy by reflecting back into the world the not-self injustices
they see humanity perpetuating on itself. They are here to prod humanity toward a cooperative,
just, peaceful and equitable global community in preparation for those born after 2027 with spirit
awareness. For Reflectors to move into this position and fulfill this role, the three other Types must
be authentic, aware and open to the Reflector’s assessment or judgment.

Manifestors, Generators and Projectors are solar Types, meaning their purpose ‘shines’ through
them. As the only lunar Type, the Reflector is designed to operate as a lunar reflection of the sun’s
programming, and to reflect the program’s neutrino imprinting process. Like the moon, the Reflector’s
‘glow’ is subtle, yet wields substantial influence, especially when it is detected or noted by others.

‘The chemistry of Reflectors’ nine undefined centers can sample as well as magnify the frequencies
of everything and everyone in their environment, giving them the potential to taste or sense what
is really happening in a way no one else can. The unique potential of their openness is to reflect
everything around them with perfect equanimity, which makes their openness an exceptional
window to wisdom. Even with all nine centers open, however, Reflectors are not more vulnerable
to conditioning than the other Types. Reflectors are, in fact, the most resilient of the four Types,
protected by an aura that is described as resistant and sampling. This unusual aura allows them to
appraise or read transient auras without taking in the frequencies too deeply. It is a gift that specially
equips them to discern if and when a person is ready to step out and express their uniqueness, rather
than remain absorbed in the homogenized world of the not-self.

When Reflectors know their design clearly, and avoid yielding to the pressures of society to
conform, their auras will protect them from identifying with anything that they take in through
their openness. They can become wise about the process, and simply remain wide open to what is
passing through them. Detecting a blip, or something that is unusual or out of line around them, is
an aspect of their gift. With their potential to easily connect to a celestial body in an ongoing and
profound way, particularly the Moon, they can have a mystical life that most of us cannot know.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 139

In many respects, they are our key to understanding and participating in global consciousness, as
their extraordinary openness is continually filtering the consciousness field. They are actually here to
sample and be one with the totality.

Reflectors are not necessarily interested in studying themselves. They are not overly interested in their
impact on others either. Every day is different for a Reflector, so the questions uppermost in their
mind are, “Who am I today?” and “Will I be surprised, included or invisible?” If they live as themselves,
theirs is truly a carefree and joy-filled nature designed to live in the wonder of the moment. The real
magic of Reflectors is expressed best in the newness, freshness and surprise that they experience every
day, and their sense that there is always something more, always something else. Unfortunately, most
Reflectors live a homogenized life, trying to be something they are not simply because they haven't
been understood or encouraged to embrace their difference. Too often, finding the world unreceptive,
cold and disappointing, they give in to expectations just to survive. When they begin to appreciate their
uniqueness and practice detachment from (or not identifying with) what they are mirroring, they will
be less apt to become lost, confused and caught up in the turmoil around them. They will accept their
place in the center rather than be left feeling invisible, and on the outside looking in.

PLACE IS KEY TO THE REFLECTOR’S HAPPINESS

Unique to Reflectors is their need to find their place in the heart of the community, or the center
of the group, so they can freely sample and reflect auric information from those around them.
It is their rightful place, and where they need to be to fulfill their purpose. They are here to be
accepting of others, to reflect the truth, and to teach the rest of us that most often what we judge
as good or bad in the world is just a revelation of our diversity. To do this, Reflectors must move
freely in their environment or amongst the participants in a gathering, and also must also be free
to leave when they realize that their reflections will not be solicited. They operate by a different
set of rules then the other Types. Reflectors truly march to a different drummer, and to know that
is to honor and respect their place and purpose. Finding the right environment within the right
community to call home, and how they go about that, is one of the most important decisions
Reflectors face. With their undefined G Center it’s helpful for them to know that people with
defined G Centers are here to initiate them; to introduce them to new people and places. Once
Reflectors have been introduced, it is their job to be discerning. When someone introduces them
to a new place or person they then come to love, Reflectors should avoid a not-self tendency to
become dependent or attached to the person who took them there.

If Reflectors remain in an unhealthy environment for any length of time, they may take on that
energy and get sick themselves, or be drained of their vitality. It’s essential for Reflectors to have
a dedicated, creative space of their own; a place where they can take time alone to shake off the
conditioning they are exposed to on a daily basis. If they don’t, they can easily become dependent on
the energies of those around them, which is a good reason to select with care the people they allow
into their inner circle of friends and family.
140 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

REFLECTOR STRATEGY: WAITING THROUGH
THE 28 DAY LUNAR CYCLE

Reflectors have no fixed definition in their chart and no dependable source of personal Authority.
‘There is no reliable source of yes or no inside them to guide them in making major decisions in their
life. The Reflector’s Strategy is to connect to the Lunar cycle, the Moon's approximately 28-day
trip around the Mandala, which encompasses all 64 gates in the wheel. This reliable and repeating
pattern provides Reflectors with a sense of consistency comparable to, but not the same as, having

a fixed definition.

Reflectors need to be initiated for the big decisions in life. Their Lunar Cycle (decision-making
process) begins when an important offer has been made or an invitation extended to them by others.
‘They cannot initiate themselves. As they progress toward clarity through the Lunar cycle, their
Reflector perceptions will change. During this time, they will want to talk with others, not to seek
advice but to articulate their own thoughts and hear their own potential truth. The quality of their
associations and the way their aura filters the world around them over time refines their decision.
‘They need to be encouraged to take their time, and not allow themselves to be pressured or rushed.
They will know suddenly, deep inside, if the offer was right for them or not. If they have completed
the Lunar cycle however, and they are still not clear, it is advisable to wait for clarity to arrive,
keeping in mind it may take more than one cycle.

Although this lunar basis for decision-making is unique to Reflectors, all Types can benefit from
understanding the Moon's repeating but transitory influence on their lives. Following the way the
Lunar cycle connects to your own chart is a fascinating process. (Examples of mapping a complete
Lunar cycle and a transit connection chart are included at the end of this section.)

REFLECTOR RELATIONSHIPS

‘The extreme openness of Reflectors can put them at the mercy of their partner's definition, making it
easy for an element of narcissism to enter the relationship. Reflectors mirror and magnify their partner's
definition back to them so what the other person may see, and may unwittingly fall in love with, is their
own reflection, not the Reflector. People who don't like themselves often fall in love with themselves
through somebody else; this process of self discovery is facilitated by the Reflector’s openness. Without
understanding, personal authenticity and clear boundaries on the part of both partners, Reflectors’
deep-seated fears of remaining invisible, of not being seen for who they really are, may well be realized.

When Reflectors are constantly rushed into decisions, or are not secure in their decision-making
process, they run the risk of becoming dependent on those who have a reliable personal Authority.
‘They then allow their partners to make decisions for them, to determine their mode of sexual
expression, their eating and sleeping habits, their occupation, where to live and their place in the
family. Reflectors can be at the mercy of the people around them. If they allow themselves to be
dominated by not-self oriented people, they will amplify that distortion in their energy field and
feel deeply disappointed by their own experience of life. There are no moment-to-moment rules for
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 141

a Reflector to follow, only the authority of waiting out the Lunar cycle so they can be clear when
making a decision. Such a process is foreign to the other Types, and when not understood it can
bring discord into the relationship and suffering to the Reflector. Reflectors that allow themselves
to be rushed and pressured are likely to have health problems later in life.

For the Reflector, a relationship is of greatest value when it is fertile and productive. Most
Reflectors love having children around them, as they bring an innocent and consistent connection
to the Reflector’s design. They enjoy relating with and ‘reflecting’ people who share their awe and
wonder for life. It is often difficult for Reflectors to cut the apron strings when it comes time to
let their children go.

REFLECTOR CHILDREN

When parents learn the Lunar pattern of Reflector children, they can encourage them to grow
according to their personal rhythm. It’s very important not to rush a Reflector child, but rather
to allow them to develop at their own pace. Over time, the children will learn to be patient and
comfortable with waiting through their Lunar cycle before making any major decisions. It is
important that parents help these children find a supportive learning environment with teachers
who will let them develop naturally. Reflector children need to be actively involved in a learning
community, but not in the usual expectation-laden way. As free spirits who operate by a different
set of rules, they will absorb and process information differently. Remember that Reflector children
take in and reflect back exactly what is going on in the family and the classroom. A thriving and
healthy Reflector child or a sick and sad Reflector child says a lot about the state of the environment.
Reflector children, like Reflector adults, need their own space so they can withdraw and be alone
when they need to be away from others. With patient practice, parents can teach their child to
protect themselves from taking in or acting on the pain of others, even though they will feel it.

THE REFLECTOR QUESTION AND
THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT-SELF BEHAVIORS

The Reflector’s deepest fear is invisibility, of not being included in a participatory way. To assuage
that fear, even though conditioning does not ‘stick’ to their aura, they may give in to the typical not-
self behaviors simply to gain attention. When Reflectors do not understand their auras, and natural
attunement to the rhythms of the cosmos, they can become confused and overcome by the motorized
energy and expectations of the dominant solar Types. They experience disappointment with others, and
are dejected by the resistance they meet in trying to initiate or manifest. Instead of being the hub of a
community, Reflectors end up feeling left out. They endure, or are overcome by, constant identification
with other people's fears, emotions, stress, and anxiety. The key for Reflectors is to stay neutral, to
avoid identifying with other people's pain, and to remain the sampling observer. As Reflectors become
comfortable with the lack of fixedness in their design, flowing with the Lunar cycle and testing the
auras of those around them, they will reflect the truth rather than the pain of others. Instead of being
distracted by their openness, they can develop the potential for great wisdom and focus on, “Who am
I right now? Who am I today?”
142 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The fears Reflectors deal with when they begin to live as themselves are:

* Who am I right now? Can I be myself?

* Will I remain invisible, or will somebody see me for my differences and include me
and my reflections?

+ Am [able to move freely within my environment so I can find my place?

* Without a fixed identity, how can I keep from taking on the anxiety, fears,
nervousness and ill-health of the not-self world around me?

HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR REFLECTORS

It is best for Reflectors, with their open Sacral Center, to go to bed before they feel totally exhausted.
By lying down or relaxing as much as an hour before they would like to be asleep, they give their
bodies a chance to unwind, and their auras time to release energies that do not belong to them, thus
preparing them for a peaceful, refreshing night's rest.

SIGNATURE GOAL: SURPRISE

‘The not-self theme for a Reflector is disappointment at the homogenized world with its distorted
not-self interactions and relationships. Reflectors live for moments when they can sample difference,
and experience awe and wonder. By remaining unattached and unidentified with energies in a
wise way, their sampling auras are rewarded by surprises. Surprise for a Reflector can mean being
included as a participant and no longer merely an observer. Reflectors are enlivened or empowered
when initiated, asked or invited to mirror the difference they see, or to share what they see is needed.

Since they notice who is operating correctly according to Type, they are here to be a signpost for
those ready to break the pattern of the illusion and become their unique, authentic Self. This is a
Reflector’s special contribution. To awaken someone to the possibility and promise of experiencing
their life as themselves is a great source of surprise and delight for the Reflector.

MAPPING A LUNAR CYCLE

REFLECTOR MANDALA AND BODYGRAPH

‘The Reflector BodyGraph in the Mandala above has many gate activations, or dormant, hanging
gates. Each one is a receptor seeking its harmonic gate at the other end of the channel. As the
Moon moves counter-clockwise through the 64 gates of the I’Ching (approximately every 28 days),
transiting planets will form harmonic connections to the Reflector’s hanging gates, thus creating
temporary definitions. Although each definition created may last only half day, over time it becomes
part of a consistent monthly pattern that provides a reliable framework for the Reflector’s decision-
making process. (See the graph that follows.) This Lunar cycle’s pattern is the Reflector’s personal
way of reflecting the Moon's frequency on Earth, and supports and defines the Reflector’s innate
sense of self. A Reflector’s identity is not revealed on a moment-to-moment basis, but through the
rhythm and flow of the full Lunar cycle.
144 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

FOLLOWING A LUNAR CYCLE THROUGH THE GATES

As the Lunar cycle brings definition to the Reflector’s chart on the previous page, he will sample
the energy frequencies and definition of a Projector, Manifestor and Generator, in addition to that
of a Reflector. Each time that the moon moves into a new gate, there is the potential for definition.
‘The moon takes approximately 28 days to go around the earth, however, it takes about 30 days to go
from full moon to the next full moon.

Having temporary definition doesn't mean Reflectors become Generators, Manifestors or Projectors,
but they can sample those particular energies. Each Reflector’s Lunar cycle is unique, and will be
the same every 28 days.

SAMPLING THE FULL TRANSIT FIELD

In addition to the Lunar cycle, Reflectors also sample the transit field, experiencing the planetary
flavors of the day. The way the transit field connects to their charts provides an ever-changing source
of personal discovery, and always carries the potential for surprise.

THE IMPERSONAL NEUTRINO CONDITIONING FIELD - IMPACTING HUMANITY
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 147

On the page to the left are three illustrations showing a Reflector chart, a Transit chart (the impersonal
neutrino conditioning field of the program) and a chart connecting the two. The paragraphs below
describe how the connection might be interpreted.

‘The beauty of waiting: On this particular day the Reflector is going to be under tremendous pressure
to act (Root Center) spontaneously (Splenic Center) on emotional desires (Channel 41-30) which
have arisen unexpectedly (Cross of the Unexpected). This hunger (Solar Plexus Center) for new
experience (Gate 36) has the potential to be spontanously expressed (Splenic Center) as crisis (Gate
36), potentially sending this Reflector into a new not-self direction of trying to perfect his form
(Channel 57-10).

In addition, he is under tremendous mental pressure (Head and Ajna Centers) to try and make
sense of life’s mysteries (Channel 61-24), and if the Reflector succumbs to the mental and physical
pressure to take action (Head and Root Center) in the moment (Splenic Center) he can be left
feeling moody and depressed (Channel 39-55). In addition, he can struggle for the wrong purpose
(Channel 38-28), experience the wrong spontaneous transformation (Channel 54-32) or enter into
the wrong experience (41-30).

To use this transit correctly, the Reflector should wait and observe all of the sensations he is
experiencing to see what is happening in the larger collective environment. By observing, he will
discover if it is personally correct to engage this energy, or if the pressure will simply dissipate with
the movement through his Lunar cycle. By continually observing his own experiences, patterns will
emerge which can eventually be creatively expressed as the wisdom of his outer authority.

THE FIVE DEFINITIONS

ENERGY DYNAMICS

As we continue to explore the different ways in which we are subject to conditioning, we come to the
Five Definitions, which give us another conditioning element that is in competition with our true-self.
Remember, when we are surrendered to our Form’s intelligence by following our Strategy and Authority,
we bypass all conditioning elements except as sources of information and potential wisdom. The five
ways in which Definition is expressed in a BodyGraph, and experienced in our life, a

* No DEFINITION —a Reflector with no centers defined (approximately 2 percent of the population).

* SINGLE DEFINITION ~ all defined channels and defined centers in the design are connected in
one continuous flow (approximately 41 percent of the population).

SIMPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION — two separate areas of definition that are not connected to each
other (approximately 46 percent of the population).

TRIPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION — three separate areas of definition that are not connected to each
other (approximately 11 percent of the population).

QUADRUPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION — four separate areas of definition that are not connected to
each other (approximately 0.5 percent of the population).

SPLITS AND HOW WE EXPERIENCE THEM

A split in a design means all defined channels and centers are not continuously connected within the
BodyGraph; a gate or channel remains open between two, three or four areas of definition. When
you have a split in your design, the quality and characteristics of the ‘missing’ gate or channel that
would bridge the split is a motivating factor in your life. You will pursue the qualities of the missing
gate or channel as though it represents something that is incomplete or wrong with your life, or as
if this is a part of you that needs to be completed or repaired.

‘These open gates or channels create not-self behaviors as a motivating force, and cause you to initiate
in order to fulfill what is perceived as missing. Remember that the missing gate/channel is not you,
but it does represent certain people you will meet over and over again, who have the missing gate or
channel, because you are drawn to the specific energy they carry within them. The attraction of that
‘missing piece’ is literally magnetic. By following your Strategy and Authority, you will meet those
who bridge your split naturally and correctly. In fact, there is nothing at all you need to do about this
missing piece. If you have multiple single-gate bridges that connect your split, each of them impacts
you in this way. Unfortunately, most people as not-self pursue their missing pieces because they
misinterpret the missing gate or channel as something incomplete within them. If you take a look at
the description (in Section Six) of the missing gate or channel that bridges your split, you will notice
important themes in your life that you most likely have been pursuing in order to feel complete.
SECTION FIVE: THE FIVE DEFINITIONS, ENERGY DYNAMICS

EXAMPLE OF DEFINITION
(SIMPLE-SPLIT)

When we have a design with a simple-split, for instance, the single gate or gates that bridge the
split become the primary conditioning forces in the life. In this illustration, the defined Ajna and
Throat Centers are split off from the defined Splenic, G, Sacral, Root and Solar Plexus Centers
with Gate 16, 8 or 20 needed to
bridge the split. Let’s concentrate
on Gate 16 for this example. This
person has Gate 48, but Gate 16
at the other end of the channel
is missing. Throat Center Gate
16, therefore, becomes a bridge
or theme this person seeks. This
means she will naturally meet lots
of people with Gate 16 because
Gate 48 is always looking for its
‘harmonic gate.’ Every gate has a
harmonic partner located at the
other end of the channel, and
the two gates coming together
literally spark each other to create
life force energy as a quantum of
the two gates.

Gate 48 is the Gate of Depth; Gate 16 is the Gate of Skills. For this person’s depth to express
itself through the Throat Center, she needs Gate 16. She may never feel she is skillful enough, and
will go out into the world looking for ways to develop her skills. In fact, she is designed to meet
people with Gate 16 who can skillfully express her depth while they work with her.

Gate 8, The Gate of Contribution, is also a bridge (missing gate), and this can drive her to think she
has to make a contribution. In reality, it is her not-self that is trying to fill the mis-perceived void.
She wants to literally become that missing piece, and ends up making mental decisions to attempt
to do just that. With a Split Definition, one will generally feel a lack of wholeness until the split is
bridged through a relationship with another person. For good or bad, this dynamic is the basis for
many relationships.

Ina wide split, which means it takes an entire channel or multiple gates to bridge the different areas
of definition, one will experience the split as being the other person's problem, or from a not-self
perspective, the other person is the cause of the problem. This can engender blame and victimhood
that are not true. On the other hand, there is a potential for wisdom in a wide split if one uses it as
an opportunity to become an unattached, objective observer of others, and does not get locked into
the blame game.Once you stop pursuing and identifying with the bridge in your split, you begin to
realize how important the people are who actually do bridge it. There have been many successful
partnerships formed by two individuals bridging an important aspect in each other’s design such
152 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

as John Lennon (Gate 48) and Paul McCartney (Gate 16). Seeing how splits operate in a healthy
way helps us to understand one of the ways we are designed to be together in relationship. In this
respect, saying “you complete me” is both profound and true. We will only have healthy and effective
relationships, however, when they are entered into correctly through Strategy and Authority.

‘There is a hierachy to conditioning that depends on the type of split definition. The conditioned
not-self mind will focus on the open gates, channels or centers to formulate its decision-making
strategy, based upon the specific definition. For a Simple-Split Definition, the bridging gate(s) that
connect the two definitions is the most powerful conditioning element in your design, followed by
the centers. If you are a Triple-Split, undefined centers are the most powerful conditioning elements
in your design, and then the bridging gates/channels. For a Quadruple-Split, the bridging gates are

again the most powerful conditioning elements, and then the undefined center.

Initiating when inappropriate, lack of patience, impulsive action or premature speech are the biggest
problems for splits when they don't take time to follow their Strategy and Authority. Those with Split
Definitions require more time to fully take in, process and digest information, simply because the
separate pieces of their definition are not connected. Until the separate definitions are connected, all
Split Definitions may feel uncomfortable, or incomplete, and unable to make clear decisions. They
must take their time, be patient, and wait for a sense of wholeness to happen. Seeking wholeness
with a specific partner by initiating, rather than waiting, is a not-self activity. If you have a split, you
are designed to have others naturally bridge your split(s) as you move through your life day by day.
Let your Strategy and Authority do the work for you.

‘This digestion and assimilation process is aided by spending time in public places where you will
be provided with neutral bridging gates by others. The best way to bridge a split, when making a
difficult or important decision, is to make use of a public place where you can still be alone, such
as a bookstore, coffee shop or walking in a shopping mall. These public melting pots of designs
will help provide neutral auras, and neutral conditioning, to assist you in the assimilation process.
The bridging available from a public place provides you with new perspectives as you ponder the
decision, whereas constantly being with friends or partners when making a decision limits you to
the ways their designs consistently connect to and condition yours.

Strategy and Authority will protect you from the potential traps set up by your splits, and you will
become more peaceful and less anxious about getting your splits resolved. Take your walk in the
world. Relax, surrender, and live from within your own personal integrity through Strategy and
Authority, and the bridging will take care of itself: The most important things to remember if you
have a split definition of any kind are to give yourself time to process information, and to trust in
your design to bring you what you need.

Let's look at a few examples on the following pages.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning is the
first example of a chart with Single
Definition. Compare this chart with
Cosima Wagner's chart below.

Single Definition describes a
chart where the energy flows
continuously through defined
channels and centers without
a break, connecting all defined
centers in the chart. It can be a
single channel like Elizabeth's or
more than one channel like the
next example. Single Definition
people are at some level self-
contained because their definition
forms a single, continuous, con-
stant, ever-present and reliable
energy. These designs can have a

very singular focus, and don't have the same need to reflect on different aspects of themselves
that the splits do. Single Definition designs do not need others to assist them in the assimilation
of information, or to feel a sense of wholeness. They digest information rapidly, unless of course

they are emotionally defined.

SINGLE DEFINITION #2

In Cosima Wagner's chart we see a
Single Definition that has multiple
centers defined (three) which are
continuously connected by the two
defined channels in her design.
These two channels link the Root,
Spleen and G Centers together for
one continuous flow of energy. Her
information assimilation process is
very quick.

Henry Miller's chart is an example
of a Simple-Split (bridged by a
single gate) Definition.

Simple-Split Definition describes
two defined areas that do not
connect to each other, where the
energy flow is broken and not
continuous. Because of this split
in Henry’s energy flow, in order to
feel complete, he always sought a
bridge (the missing gate) to link
the separate energetic definitions
between his mind and his Throat.
One single gate bridges this split,
Throat Center Gate 62, the Gate
of the Preponderance of the
Small (Detail). Gate 62 bridged
his mental process to his intuitive

knowing, and was a very significant gate in his life. His life was focused on the details; researching

the details and meeting others that could supply the detail. And Henry was indeed very focused

on writing down the details in the books he authored.

Comparing Stephen Hawkings’
Wide-Split Definition with Henry
Miller's Simple Split, we see a
Wide-Split Definition bridged
by multiple gates or a channel
through the Throat Center. The
bridge for this split is through Gate
20 plus Gate 43. Stephen would
experience his incompleteness, or
sense that something is missing, as
“the other person's problem” rather
than his own. He can and does
use the wide split as a source of
potential wisdom, observing and
studying the world (or universe)
quite objectively.
SECTION FIVE: THE FIVE DEFINITIONS, ENERGY DYNAMICS 155

TRIPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION

Like Timothy Leary (shown
here), Triple-Split Definitions
have three separate areas of
definition in their design that are
not connected to each other. These
individuals need several bridges
to connect all of their defined
channels. The main conditioning
elements for them are their
undefined centers. In Timothy’s
design, the undefined Heart and
Solar Plexus Centers are the main
conditioning elements. The gates
that bridge the splits are also
conditioning elements, but are
not as powerful as the undefined
centers. Triple-Splits are subject
to impatience and often act
prematurely. They can be seen as
driven, ambitious and assertive. It is healthy for those who have Triple or Quadruple-Splits to
interact with a number of different people (many different auras) each day. If they are continually
conditioned by one person, they can feel trapped.

THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE

Circuitry explores the way energy circulates through the channels within the BodyGraph. When
the circuits are diagrammed as illustrated, the BeayGHEh resembles a circuit board. pceretanclng
circuitry opens the door to understanding the flow of the life force, and reveals the way all life
forms are differentiated yet designed to connect to each other. Circuits are composed pecenetts
A channel is composed of two gates and connects two centers. The gates in a chart are entry and
exit points for the flow of energy to and from the centers. Centers are the hubs that transform
and transmute the frequency. The flow or circulation of energy through a channel is like a spark of
life that establishes communication between two centers. This
basic form of communication is called a “life force” because it
carries the potential for growth and evolution within the form.

Thisresulting life force definition is projected and communicated
through our auras, and influences or conditions those close to
us. Definition in our chart both defines our gifts and determines
our limitations for the duration of our life. Fach erson’s or each
form's life force is unique and distinguishable Real all others.
Definition represents our reason for incarnating, and it must
be expressed through us authentically without the not-self
distortion of conditioning. There are 36 channels and 64 gates
within the Rave BodyGraph. Circuitry ties them together and
gives the bodygraph a solid infrastructure. This infrastructure
is composed ‘of the Integration Channel and three Circuit
Groups that map the distinctly different yet interconnecting
routes or ways energy flows between centers. Circuitry creates
a general framework for interpreting the chart of a complex human being. Each channel, with its
two gates, adds its theme to that framework.

THE INTEGRATION CHANNEL AND THE THREE CIRCUIT GROUPS

In Section Two we learned that pressure from the Head and Root Centers moves energy through
the BodyGraph toward the Throat Center for expression. As energy flows along the BodyGraph’s
pathways, channels and their gates are bundled together forming six basic circuits, plus four additional
channels that are known together as the Integration Channel. The six basic circuits form three main
circuit groups, The Individual Circuit Group, The Collective Circuit Group and the Tribal Circuit
Group. The Integration Channel is a distinct and unified field of energy. When viewed through the
context of circuitry, the definition in a chart shows the ways our fundamental nature, values and
principles connect to, interact with and impact others. It is often here, in the realm of circuits and
channels, that the source of resistance and conflict between people is revealed, along with their
conditioning. The keynotes, therefore, are of great significance in providing important insight
into understanding the unique frequency, or combination of frequencies, of one’s auric projection.

The Integration Channel stands on its own alongside the three main circuit groups in the
infrastructure of the BodyGraph; it is the most complex system of all the channels. This group of
four channels, which forms a backbone-like structure in the BodyGraph, serves as the key defense
mechanism of the form. Integration is the core component of the individuation process, the process
of distinguishing ourself from others. Without it, we could not have differentiated from our primate
ancestors. The Integration Channel fuels the evolutionary process of humanity person by person,
and contains the full, active expression of the life force of the form.

With a super keynote of ‘self-empowerment,’ the Integration Channel is focused entirely on self-
preservation and empowering the individual nature, expression, knowing, direction/identity and
behavior of the self. The survival of the Individual, and the drive to be unique, is essential to ensuring
the survival of the Tribe and the Collective through mutation.

‘The natural primal reflexes built into Integration assure us that we can trust the life that lies within
us when it is empowered by response (Gate 34), guided by intuition (Gate 57), directed by the
correct behavior (Gate 10) and manifested in the now (Gate 20). When expressed as a unit, using
Integration’s keynotes by channel, it says, “I love myself and I empower myself by listening to my
intuition in the now.” Or, “Through response I am intuitively equipped with the right behavior
to survive any circumstance in the now.” Those with definition in the Integration Channel are
concerned with self-empowerment, and express themselves with a notable self-sufficiency and
self-assuredness that neither looks to nor easily accepts direction from others. They should be
allowed and encouraged to be self-sufficient.

The Channels and Gates of the Integration Channel are discussed on the following pages.
162 _THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF POWER: 34 - 57
A Design of an Archetype
Channel: Integration Channel Type: Generated

‘The Channel of Power links the Splenic center to the Sacral Center through
the Gate of Intuitive Insight (57) and the Gate of Power (34). Channel
34-57 is the archetype of what it is to be an individuated human being. Its
energy empowers our intuitive capacity to survive through response, keeping
us alive by alerting us to danger.

Background: In the Channel of Power, the generative life force of the Sacral
empowers the existential awareness (survival intelligence) of the Spleen,
keeping us alert, attuned to our bodies and constantly on guard for anything
that might constitute a threat in our immediate environment. Gate 34 has
great power to engage in and sustain activity. Gate 57 operates on an inner sound/vibration level,
constantly penetrating and screening its environment. When the two gates are combined within the
channel, an archetype emerges based in ancient mammalian memory with a fight or flight instinct to
survive. Without this defensive intuitive intelligence empowered to act spontaneously, we would not
and could not have individuated or evolved as a species. It is through the 57th Gate that the entire
awareness process began its flowering within humanity. Intuition is rooted in Splenic awareness,
and arises instantaneously, free of the time constraints of mental and emotional awareness. In other
words, it is never what we ¢hink is good for us that will protect us, but rather how we intuitively
respond to the diverse vibrations of places or the people around us in the moment.

Personal: In order to react clearly and quickly, or make those split second decisions needed to
literally save your life such as jumping out of the way of a speeding car, you must be consistently
grounded in and connected to your body consciousness. This often means being highly selective
regarding the verbal input of others, and always listening with your right ear to hear what they are
really saying. Following your Generator Strategy frees up your blend of Splenic intuition and Sacral
power, allowing it to bring you safely through each moment of your life. Determined to keep you
independent, alive, acoustically alert and physically fit, this is an amazing capacity that you can learn
to trust completely. Finely honed to your individual survival, it does not take into account the needs
and wants of anyone other than you. The great and enduring power undergirding this channel of the
“archetype” is the experience of yourself as an aware and unique being. Once self-empowered, you
become an inspiring example of what it means to enjoy being a vitally alive, differentiated human
being, pure and unconditioned, living moment by moment in response. If you find yourself prone to
melancholy, embrace your moods without trying to fix them or figure them out.

Interpersonal: People with the Channel of Power have the potential to perfect their powers of
survival through intuitively-based response. They do not generally take kindly to anything or anyone
that dares to disturb their realm of well-being, and can become defensive, if necessary, in order to
maintain it. Having evolved beyond the eat-or-be-eaten level of existence, they now rely on their
alertness to sustain a healthy vitality that allows them to survive long enough to experience and
appreciate the gifts of our species’ growing powers of awareness.

GATE 34: THE POWER OF THE GREAT - THE GATE OF POWER
— Power is only great when its display or use serves the common good —
Center: Sacral Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of Power — LAC of Duality

Gate 34 is a potent and impressive source of energy that empowers us toward individuation,
displaying and celebrating our uniqueness in the world. Two qualities distinguish this gate from the
other eight in the Sacral: its asexuality and the unavailability of its power to others. If connected
to Gate 10 in your G Center, your energy will be focused on social behaviors or roles that support
your strong convictions. If connected to Gate 20 in your Throat, your power will be resolved to act
on your own behalf, to turn your thoughts into deeds, and to express your ability to manifest and
thrive. If connected to Gate 57 in your Spleen, your intuition will empower your ability to hear what
you need to survive perfectly in each moment. Without the Spleen's direct intuitive guidance, this
relentless power to act may become an unhealthy, meddlesome and misdirected energy, and you
may feel lost in your own momentum, expending energy that serves no one. Though admired, and

With its clarity of intuitive insight, Gate 57 has the capacity to penetrate to one’s core in the now.
You have a deep inner attunement to sound that is constantly alert to the vibrations coming from
your physical, emotional and psychic environments. Moment by moment your intuition registers a
sense of what is safe, healthy and good for you, and what is not. Gate 57 is the gate of the right ear. If
you want to hear what someone is really saying to you, listen with your intuitively attuned right ear.
You must be alert and focused in the now to hear the messages from your Spleen, or the information
you are getting for survival may be ignored. You may sometimes appear deaf to others, or be accused
of selectively hearing what they have to say, but your intuition is your only guide in determining
what the perfect behavior is that will insure your well-being. The only way you will alleviate your
fears for the future is to pay close attention to your instinctual hunches, to that little voice that only
speaks once and softly, and act on these hunches immediately. When you are listening and paying
attention to your intuition now, there is no tomorrow to fear.

THE CHANNEL OF CHARISMA: 34 - 20
A Design where Awareness must Become Deed
Channel: Integration Channel Type: Manifesting Generated

The Channel of Charisma links the Sacral Center to the Throat Center
through the Gate of Power (34) and the Gate of the Now (20). This is the
classic Manifesting Generator channel where the drive to manifest is guided
by Sacral response. In other words, the Warrior (Manifestor) must surrender
to the Buddha (Generator), and wait to respond to external stimuli for one’s
charismatic power to be properly directed into the world.

Background: The Channel of Charisma is one of three oppositions (43-23
and 37-40 are the other two) in the Rave Mandala, making this definition a
common and consistent life force in the world. When the raw power of Gate
34, a pure physiological energy, is processed through the thyroid system, it becomes a key energetic
component empowering humanity's survival. The Sacral exerts its pressure to stay busy on Gate
20, pushing it to expression NOW. The speed with which generative power meets manifestation
happens so quickly that it almost bypasses response, which explains why a person with this channel
often has difficulty sitting still or being quiet. Though their scope of influence and accomplishment
can be amazing, but the without awareness to stay connected to the inner guidance of the Sacral
that same driving energy can manifest as an obsession, or erupt spontaneously and get carried away
by its own momentum like a misguided missile.

Personal: The energy of Channel 34-20 is part of the Integration (self-empowerment) process, and
because you have the power to maintain activity over long periods of time, it is essential that you
apply your energy to something you deeply love doing. Other people may envy your manifesting
energy, but it is not available for them to tap into. Your awareness that must become deeds (actions)
is whatever Gate 34's generative power is immediately focused on, as that energy has to be available
for you to manifest in the moment. It is correct and healthy for you to remain busily self-absorbed
in an activity that is correct and satisfying for you, while remaining generally unavailable to others.
In this way, your genuine vitality and self empowerment emerges spontaneously with its potential to
naturally inspire others. This is the true nature of charisma. When your Sacral response is replaced
by the mind’s should’s or could’s, however, your great personal power will be diffused or misdirected,
compromising your health and your ability to be an example.

Interpersonal: Most people with charisma appear generally unavailable to others. As Individuals
with the potential to act or manifest in the moment, they often find themselves doing just that.
Their dilemma is that they can be so busy being busy they don't always recognize where guidance
may be needed. Proper manifesting is of enormous benefit to society; chaotic manifesting is deeply
destructive. If someone with Channel 34-20 does not have access to guidance from within their own
design that tempers and directs their busyness, such as Gate 57’s intuitive insight for example, or
Gate 10’s behavior of the self, then it is natural and healthy for them to be open to the guidance or
advice of someone with Channel 43-23's individual knowing and insight.

GATE 34: THE POWER OF THE GREAT - THE GATE OF POWER
— Power is only great when its display or use serves the common good —

Center: Sacral Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of Power — LAC of Duality

Gate 34 is a potent and impressive source of energy that empowers us toward individuation,
displaying and celebrating our uniqueness in the world. Two qualities distinguish this gate from the
other eight in the Sacral: its asexuality and the unavailability of its power to others. If connected
to Gate 10 in your G Center, your energy will be focused on social behaviors or roles that support
your strong convictions. If connected to Gate 20 in your Throat, your power will be resolved to act
on your own behalf, to turn your thoughts into deeds, and to express your ability to manifest and
thrive. If connected to Gate 57 in your Spleen, your intuition will empower your ability to hear what
you need to survive perfectly in each moment. Without the Spleen’s direct intuitive guidance, this
relentless power to act may become an unhealthy, meddlesome and misdirected energy, and you
may feel lost in your own momentum, expending energy that serves no one. Though admired, and
even sought after, your energy is simply not available to others. It must remain pure in its power, and
always accessible to you as you seek to be independent and unique, to act on your convictions, and
to triumph, which means to survive as yourself.

GATE 20: CONTEMPLATION - THE GATE OF THE Now
— Recognition and awareness in the now which transforms understanding into right action —
Center: Throat Quarter: Civilization Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of the Now - LAC of Duality

Gate 20 is a purely existential gate that keeps you focused in the present, and supports your capacity
to survive as yourself. When your expression is properly timed, awareness will be transformed into
words or actions that can impact people around you. This energy frequency is, and must be, totally
absorbed in the present moment. It can give voice to Gate 57’s intuitive survival awareness, to Gate
10's behavioral patterns and commitments to higher principles, or it can manifest Gate 34’s sacral
power through action toward individuation. Gate 20 expresses the full range of being in the moment
from “I am now” to “I know I am myself doing now,” but it does not consider the past or the future.
To be awake and aware, and to survive, you must be fully present to the moment and authentically
yourself. There is rarely time to mentally consider or control what comes bubbling up from inside
of you, so what you say or what you do is suddenly there for everybody, including you, to witness.
In fact, you often see when you are not looking, or hear when you are not listening. This is how the
potential for evolutionary change hidden in each moment of existence is empowered within you.
As you live by your Strategy and Authority, you become a living example. Your intuitive knowing,
personal survival and mutative, self-loving behaviors influence or empower others.

THE CHANNEL OF PERFECTED Form: 57 - 10
A Design of Survival
Channel: Integration (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Perfected Form links the Splenic Center to the G Center
ia through the Gate of Intuitive Insight (57) and the Gate of the Behavior
fi of the Self (10). This is Integration’s creative channel — the art of survival.
It projects a quality of behavior that is guided by intuitive awareness, and
grounded in loving and appreciating oneself. This behavior is the core of our
species’ ability to survive, one person at a time.

Background: Splenic awareness is focused primarily on physical well-being.
Channel 57-10 supports Gate 10’s focus on how to interact with others
in order to perfect or assure the Individual’s survival. The self-oriented
and potentially mutative behaviors of the Individual must survive in order to effect evolutionary
change within humanity as a whole. Individual behaviors that are unique, and perfectly adapt our
physical forms to surviving, exemplify for others what it means to live fully in the moment. Gate
57 carries an acute acoustic sensitivity to the quality of sounds in one’s immediate environment.
Paying more attention to someone's tone of voice, rather than to the words spoken, automatically
connects Channel 57-10 to our oldest form of awareness, an innate, spontaneous, intuitive wisdom
that exists outside of thoughts and emotions. This channel gives a person a rare clarity and ability to
act spontaneously and appropriately to anything perceived to be out of order in their environment.

Personal: As you let your deeply intuitive impulses guide your behaviors moment by moment,
you automatically release unfounded fears for the future, fears that can keep you from fully loving
yourself and embracing your life. You embody the potential to move through the world existentially
and unencumbered. This ability to “think on your feet” spontaneously perfects your form, perfectly
ensuring your survival in the now. There is a beauty inherent in this process that makes you happy
and fills you with joy. The spontaneity and nature of your creativity are quite different from the
creative process of self-reflection which the mind enjoys, or the depth and diversity of emotional
sensitivity that comes over time through the Solar Plexus. By simply living true to yourself, you create
something healthy and beautiful with your life. Such uniqueness attracts attention and impacts
people around you as your example invites all of us to find the value of living life as ourselves.

Interpersonal: People with the Channel of Perfected Form are here to create what they love, and
love what they create. Recognition is not their motivation. They have the capacity to love themselves
enough to stay true to themselves, while intuitively behaving in ways that insure their survival in
society. This is an unapologetically selfish and self-absorbed process, an on-going journey of creating
and perfecting that which is uniquely them and expressing it through their lives. In overt and subtle
ways, they impact their environment, leaving it healthier and more beautiful than they originally
encountered it. Many artists, architects, designers and doctors who have this channel mold the
world around them, but by example, not intention. This is the natural by-product of authentic living.

Gate 10 is the most complex gate in the G Center, and one of the four Gates of the Incarnation Cross

self (listed below) are guided by the intuition of Gate 57, empowered by the Sacral response of Gate
34, and manifested or expressed through Gate 20. Within the framework of these roles, humanity
is now exploring what it means to live as a 9-centered, self-aware form with its potential to awaken,
and to experience genuine self love. With your Strategy and Authority in place, Gate 10 empowers
your potential to surrender to living authentically as yourself. As you come to know, accept and love
what makes you unique, you empower others to love themselves as well. True awakening through
surrender is not a commitment to becoming something; it is a commitment to being yourself. Gate
10's strong emphasis on loving self-acceptance will deeply impact how humanity moves through the
21st century. You are one who recognizes that awakening is not possible without self-acceptance.
As you embrace the honor and pleasure of exploring life in a self-aware form, you empower our
potential to live as our true selves, awake in the now moment.

THE CHANNEL OF AWAKENING: 10 - 20
A Design of Commitment to Higher Principles
Channel: Integration Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Awakening links the G Center to the Throat Center through
the Gate of the Behavior of the Self (10) and the Gate of the Now (20). For
the awake and aware, each moment presents an opportunity for recognition
and commitment to principles that transform Individual knowing into right
action (Gate 20). This is action that is tempered by an underlying code of
behavior ensuring successful interaction with others (Gate 10).

Background: The Channel of Awakening says, “I AM! I am alive NOW!”
This is the fullest, most poignant, selfish and primal expression of the
essence of being. It is the wonder of human consciousness, “I survived; I am
a survivor.” Buddha means “the awakened one.” The two pillars of the awakened life are self-love
and self-trust: “I am and I can because I love (myself).” In the simplest Human Design terms, to be
awake means making decisions as yourself and living by them. When you are able to live your own

design, to love being yourself no matter what the cost or how mundane your experience, you are as
awake as the Buddha.

Personal: The G Center is not an awareness center so Channel 10-20 can only do one thing — it speaks
for itself. It perfectly expresses the wisdom that to survive, flourish, and experience the love of life, you
must fulfill your potential to behave as a living expression of awakened self love, acceptance and trust.
You are normally in a constant state of awakening, of being recognized by others, of becoming aware
of yourself as your life unfolds before you. Your survival and your self-empowerment are the end result
of embracing, loving, accepting and living as yourself in each moment, they are evidenced by others
through your decisions, speech and interactions, and your behavior in the world. For you to have your
intended impact on people around you, to fulfill your potential as Integration’s voice of leadership,
others must sense that there is something clear and awake about you because you cannot see it clearly
in yourself. Simply by being yourself, you will influence and inspire people around you to be themselves,
most often without you knowing it. This is the kind of recognition that elicits proper invitations from
others, invitations which keep you from meeting resistance, from taking criticism personally, and from
becoming burdened by your uniqueness and a natural tendency toward self-absorption.

Interpersonal: The six lines of the 10th gate indicate which behavioral principle those with Channel
10-20 are committed to. The 1st line says that one has the potential to be awake in the moment
through the ability to know how to act, no matter what the circumstances. The 2nd line is designed for
independent self-absorbed behavior, and it withdraws into isolation when the conditioning of others
wants to pull it away from its true nature. The 3rd line’s trial and error testing process can ultimately
be of great value to humanity by discovering what does and does not work. The 4th line will wait for
the right moment and opportunity to externalize what it knows in order to influence and awaken
people close to it. The 5th line will awaken and bring change through directly and overtly challenging
the accepted, underlying traditions of society. The 6th line awakens others by its example rather than
words; through the expression of its true nature in the actions of day to day living.

INDIVIDUAL CIRCUIT GROUP
SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 171

We begin with the Individual Circuit Group because of its close ties to, and yet distinctive differences
from, the core Integration Channel. Individuality has both the capacity and the responsibility to be
a force for change in the world, to bring mutation to the Tribe and the Collective. The challenge is
to do so without being rejected by either group.

The Individual Circuit Group is the most complex of the three groups, and encompasses the
frequencies of all nine centers. It is oriented to the present moment with attention focused on
listening to the beat of its own drum, and its determination to follow its own direction. The
Individual’s drive for uniqueness becomes a living example that inspires or empowers or awakens
a latent potential in others. Mutation and empowerment, the keynotes associated with Individual
Circuitry, are at the heart of The Human Design System, and of evolution itself. For the Individual,
these keynotes imply a passion for being true to one’s self, for thinking about and being uniquely
attuned to the present moment, and for living independent of the norm. Individuals, when their
knowing becomes clear, stand ready to embody inspiration or differentiation, which is their way of
leading by example. Their gift is recognizing the mutative potential in everything and everyone, and
the intuitive sense of the possibility for empowering it.

Individual knowing isn’t based on either proven facts or experiential learning, but rather on intuition
and/or the inspiration in the moment, which is why Individuals do not fit easily into society. It is
imperative, as well as advantageous, that Individuals learn how to explain themselves from childhood
on. They need to be able to communicate what they hear as inspiration in the moment, and what they
know inside to be true. This ability to explain facilitates their effectiveness as agents for change, and
eases their personal feelings of being different.

Individuality attracts attention, but Individuals usually need and like to be left alone to explore their
creative and melancholic inner world. They can become so caught up in the moment that they often
appear deaf to the voices of experience and reason. This is because they are here to be true to what is
new in the moment, and to model it, act on it, or communicate it. In order to be comfortable with their
position in the scheme of things, and to be ready to connect with others in that precious yet illusive
empowering moment, it is necessary for the Individual to stay closely attuned to their Authority and
follow their Strategy.

‘The Individual Circuit Group is composed of one major circuit, the Knowing Circuit, and one
minor circuit, the Centering Circuit.

‘The role of those with definition in the Knowing Circuit is to be empowered to live as themselves.
‘They empower others by being an individual example of uniqueness. Their way of re-ordering life,
reflected in their lifestyle, requires an audience as this is how they bring mutation into the world.
‘They need to be observed and to be recognized for their uniqueness.

As the name of the circuit implies, it is the inspired and intuitive knowing of each moment, in
combination with the passionate or melancholic moodiness of the emotional wave, that forms or
shapes the mutative impact the Individual’s thoughts and behavior have on the rest of us. This
combination is what makes the Individual’s unpredictable, creative and unique moment by moment
knowing empowering. Individuality is not about perfecting, mastering or organizing something.
‘That is the Collective's contribution. Individuality is about birthing something totally new with the
potential to transform both the Individual and the world around him.

‘The nature of Individual knowing is that it comes and goes; it’s there and it’s not there. Individuals
don’t know until they know. This knowing might be the answer, the right direction, or it might not.
For Individual mutation to take hold universally, its value and validity must be tested over time.
‘The power to mutate, which is common to all channels and gates in the Individual Group Circuit,
is dependent on the on/off timing of this sudden knowing. Mutation operates in a pulse that
cannot be controlled or anticipated. The fixed timing of the conservative Collective Circuit, and the
hierarchical nature of the Tribal Circuit, keeps those circuit groups from engaging the inspiration
or mutation of the moment on their own. Both groups are obliged to look to the Individual as a
guiding force for change and transformation, helping them to avoid stasis and promoting their
evolutionary progress. This energy of the new, however, leads the Collective and the Tribe to place
Individual knowing under careful scrutiny, and leaves it open to criticism, which is why it is essential
for all Individuals to be able to explain themselves.

Individuals are often admired for their difference and envied for the attention they receive. Their
path is a vulnerable, truly personal, and sometimes lonely one however, and Individuals may never
know that they have empowered someone else.

‘The Channels and Gates of the Knowing Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
174 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF MUTATION: 3 - 60
A Design of Energy which Initiates and Fluctuates - Pulse
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Generated

‘The Channel of Mutation links the Root Center to the Sacral Center through
the Gate of Acceptance (60) and the Gate of Ordering (3). The potential for
evolutionary change that comes through this unpredictable, mutative and
melancholic channel depends on one’s capacity to accept limitation (Gate
60) and transcend the confusion of new beginnings (Gate 3).

= Background: Gate 60 is the hub of all evolutionary possibilities, while Gate
oe 3 is always reaching for what is new and potentially viable, one possibility
z at a time. The underlying current or frequency governing this adrenalized
generating Channel of Mutation is the format energy* of Individual Circuitry.
Its potent, on/off pulsing energy, associated with melancholy, permeates the
way those with this channel live out their unique designs. This is an energy
that also conditions or deeply affects everyone around them.

Personal: Your key to living with this melancholic process, a mechanical
moodiness, is to avoid trying to reason it away. It is better to remain patient
and alert as you wait for the new mutation to arrive on the scene through
you. Time spent alone with your muse, when the pulse of mutation is off, a f

can deepen and enrich your inner journey. Although you can’t always see
it, something is stirring underneath, and what is not yet ready to emerge
continues to gestate and grow. This endless movement from chaos to order to FoRMaAT ENERGY
chaos is the nature of the format energy as it always engenders the possibility

for something new to come into the world. You only have to accept the limitation inherent in not
knowing when this change (this pulse) will happen, and surrender to your Sacral response to bring
the energy of change to all of us.

Interpersonal: Like music, mutation takes place suddenly, unexpectedly, in the gaps or the spaces
between the pulses, or notes. It forces everyone to adapt or change, or be left behind. Those with the
Channel of Mutation feel the pressure to bring innovation and renewal to their lives, jobs, families
and the world around them. The Root Center's constant pressure creates inner tension during the
times when the on/off pulse is off and seemingly nothing is happening. This is experienced on a
chemical level in the body as melancholy. As agents of mutation and change, Individuals may find
themselves trying to give reasons for their moods, and getting caught in the discomforting, shadow
places within themselves which they normally tend to avoid. If they give in to this shadow, or do
not wait for the correct response, the pressure to change the way things are done can lead to deep
personal frustration and depression, as well as instability and chaos in those around them.

“Format energies exert a powerful influence on all other channels in the circuit, and the design as a whole.
Format Channels run between the Root and Sacral Centers: 53-42 (Collective/Abstract), 60-3 (Individual)
and 52-9 (Collective/Logical). There is no format channel for the Tribal Circuit.

GATE 3: DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING - THE GATE OF ORDERING
~ The fundamental challenge of initiation is to transcend confusion and establish order —

RAC of the Laws — JC of Mutation — LAC of Wishes

The function of Gate 3 is to transcend confusion and establish order so that something new and
potentially viable can take hold in the world. You have a connection to unique Individual knowing,
personal innovation, and the potential for making a significant contribution. Waiting for the right
moment for something mutative to happen can feel like forever. You will need patience to accept
Gate 60's occasional bursts of energy, and the unknown timing of its limited releases of potential.
‘There is an on-off creative pulse that prevails here, and the potential for something new is neither
logical nor experiential. If you don’t wait for the right timing, for the structures needed for true
mutation to settle into place, your enthusiasm for change will simply destabilize those around you,
rather than empower and influence them. You may experience melancholy and even depression
when you feel that there is no energy fueling your potential to bring change. This is a time, however,
for you to go deep into your own process, to spend time with your own creative muse. You cannot
predict, control or rush the mutative moment. It has its own timing. And anyone who steps into
your aura, at the right time, can be changed without you even lifting a finger.

RAC of Laws —JC of Limitation - LAC of Distraction

Gate 60 creates the pressure needed for pure energy to mutate into form. Here the Root Center
fuels restraint, which enables the pressure to build under each possibility. The creative mutative
process is subject to a pulse, and you never know when something that has the potential to become
a mutation will be released. A viable mutation transcends existing limitations when it is empowered
or given order by Gate 3. Mutation takes place in the “space between the notes” created by the on-
off pulse of the 60th gate. The pressure from your Root Center creates a deep restlessness in you
to move ahead, and limitations of any kind may feel like roadblocks. If you become impatient with
the unpredictable mutative process, however, the melancholy inherent in the 60th gate can deepen
and become chronic depression. When you feel you cannot affect change around you, look inward.
Accept the mystery of the mutative process and trust that transformation is occurring within you,
and because of you in the world around you. Gate 3 plays a key role in bringing order to the potential

THE CHANNEL OF THE BEAT: 14-2
A Design of being a Keeper of Keys
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Generated

‘The Channel of the Beat links the Sacral Center to the G Center through the
Gate of Power Skills (14) and the Gate of Higher Knowing (2). Gate 14 is
particularly focused on the availability of material resources to fuel mutation,
and Gate 2 is the seat of the Driver (the Magnetic Monopole) which holds
us together and directs our movement in time through space. Together, as the
Channel of the Beat, they are poised to take us in a new direction.

Background: Channel 14-2 is one of three Tantric* channels in the
Bodygraph (the Individual tantric channel) and has all the characteristics
of Individuality such as mutation, innovation, unusualness, newness,
uniqueness, and melancholy. The Sacral Center is the source of pure generative energy that gives
birth to and sustains life on this planet. The G Center represents identity, direction and love. The
energy that is generated when you combine Gate 2, Higher Knowing, with Gate 14, Power Skills,
is a very potent resource for the creative, fertile life force that empowers change in our direction.

Personal: As the Keeper of Keys, you have access to essential resources necessary to transform
the mutative impulse into a material direction. You can bring an innovative and empowering new
direction to people, projects and the planet simply by listening to and trusting your Sacral response,
even though you don't know where it is taking you or what kind of mutative impact it will have on
others. You are able to sustain your own creative efforts, or materially provide for and encourage
others in their own creative direction. All Individuality empowers through example, and your first
task is to be true to yourself, and live into your own destiny, direction and purpose. If you attempt to
chase after your destiny, you will end up feeling lost and frustrated. By trusting that life will make
decisions through you, you empower others in a purely mechanical way. People passing through your
healthy auric field might find their own sense of direction being initiated or have a new direction
take hold within them. All you need to do is remain open and responsive to life.

Interpersonal: The Collective and the Tribe are focused on security and the status quo. Channel
14-2 gives the Individual the key to bring new directions to the planet by introducing critical new
perspectives into the mix so that we can continue to evolve, and meet the ever-changing challenges
of existence. Eventually, the Collective and the Tribe will test and adapt the perspectives that
best apply. Mutation in Channel 14-2 is something that just happens in the pulse as a matter of
deep response to life, and to the identity and direction of the higher self. One moment it is there
and the next it is not. We never know when the new direction will come, where it will take the
Individual, or how it will mutate the Collective or the Tribe.

“The three Tantric channels between the Sacral and G Centers (5-15 , 14-2, 29-46) allow the fertile
power of the Sacral Center to connect to and empower the identity, direction and love of the higher self
in the G Center.

Gate 14 empowers direction for the individual, and humanity, through the distribution of available
resources. The Gate of Power Skills makes sure that mutation is supported, and shows us how to
invest our resources in order to expand our horizons. The Sacral Center, when defined, has the
energy to sustain long hours of creative work, and the 14th gate is fertile power at its most exalted.
‘This is the gas pedal that controls when and how the resources are released. When you are aligned
with your design, and doing the work you love to do, you will generate wealth and power. These
resources are not directly for your own use, however, but yours to manage in order to empower
others, to support individual creativity, charitable activities, or leaders with a vision for humanity's
future. Just throwing your money, however, at anything or anyone, is a poor investment. To protect
your valuable life force energy from misuse or abuse by others, and to remain properly aligned in
order to bring out the right mutative direction, follow your Authority. When properly directed by
Gate 2, your resources can become a significant catalyst for empowering change in the world.

The ‘higher’ knowing of Gate 2 is rooted in the direction of the self toward love and beauty via
the Magnetic Monopole, the Driver. The Driver is focused on our movement in time through
space, and built into your design is an innate sense of inner direction which is not based simply on
geographic location. You cannot change this direction through your mind or your will, and if others
are not going in your direction, you may come to a parting of ways. Gate 2 is likened to the key
of the vehicle; it starts the engine for the Driver. The motor and the fuel to keep moving in your
direction come from the Sacral Center through Gate 14. You may even find yourself directing other
people toward the resources they need to support their creative endeavors, or discover that by simply
aligning to your own direction you automatically empower or confirm in others their own sense of
direction. You are a visionary providing the plan or overview for a new way forward, but you are not
here to do the work or make it happen. You look to Gate 14 for allies, for the power and resources
to bring your vision to fruition.

THE CHANNEL OF INSPIRATION: 1 - 8
A Design of a Creative Role Model
Circuit: Knowing (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Inspiration links the G Center to the Throat Center
through the Gate of Self Expression (1) and the Gate of Contribution
(8). Gate 1 is the Individual’s doorway to creatively expressing a mutative
perspective, either through their auric presence, or in a form that can be
promoted and displayed for all to experience. It takes courage to stand out
from the crowd, and to inspire others to be equally bold. For this channel,
living as an Individual is an art, and designed to get the public’s attention.

Background: Channel 1-8 provides the public outlet for both the creative
(Gate 1) and leadership (Gate 8) potentials of the Knowing Circuit. Through
the voice of the Role Model it says, “I know I can (or can't) make a creative contribution” to the
evolving goals of the group. People with this channel have an impact on the world around them by
living and fully expressing the unique nature of their identity. This impact is not achieved with words or
explanations but by example, by modeling their Individual direction. They do it, they live it, and when
Channel 1-8 is connected to a motor (through Channel 2-14 for instance) their contribution can be
even more impressive.

Personal: The nature of Individual direction is to move toward beauty, powered by its own truth, and
grounded in the moment. You are designed to model what it means to be a self-expressed, creative
Individual, and attract, deservedly, the attention of others. As you do so, you potentially change their
perspective. You inspire new directions in others, and free them to express their own uniqueness
creatively, like the pianist whose extraordinary performance inspires a person in the audience to take
piano lessons. For this kind of Individual leadership-by-example to have an impact it must come
from a place of authentic personal authority that is safe from casual, or conditioning, influences.
Also essential is the recognition that your potential to inspire or empower others is actually a co-
creation between your dedication to living your Individuality, which naturally attracts attention,
and others’ recognition of your Individuality. Channel 1-8 lacks a built-in social adeptness, and it
is incumbent on you to develop the skills needed to effectively communicate what you are here to
contribute, which includes cultivating the patience to wait for the correct timing to do so. The key to
your flowering is being recognized, accepted, and applauded for your individuality, and the creative
impact you promote.

Interpersonal: Individual-style leaders (mutating or empowering by example) draw others along
with them by initiating changes in the ways people see, act and think about life, truth and the nature
of beauty. An underlying recognition that nothing can exist outside of the totality contributes to their
overall impact on society. Those with the Channel of Inspiration know how to live their uniqueness
with exuberance, and in the process they empower others to be their own unique, inspiring and
differentiated selves.
SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 179

— Creation as a primal force. The energy potential to manifest inspiration without limitation —
Center:G Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Sphinx — JC of Self-Expression— LAC of Defiance

Gate 1 is the drive, and deep need, to focus on expressing oneself in unique and creative ways. You
are not concerned with being the best, which is a comparative trait of the Collective. You simply
want to live out your true creative nature, your authentic individuality. When happily absorbed in
doing “your own thing,” you are not aware that you are attracting the attention of others. It is while
you are being true to your creative process that what you are doing, and how you are doing it, has its
greatest impact. As you exemplify new ways of expressing your authentic self, you empower others
to consider new perspectives or new ways of being in the world. You may even change their creative
direction. Your creativity inspires others by example, and for your impact to be properly felt, it must
be seen or heard to be appreciated. This requires interaction with the world, and waiting for an
invitation. Without Gate 8, what you probably find least attractive is marketing your own work. You
will often find yourself drawn to people with Gate 8 because they are better equipped, or in a better
position, to promote your work for you.

— The basic worth realized in contributing individual efforts to group goals —
Center: Throat Quarter: Civilization Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form

Gate 8 says, “I know I can contribute, or not.” Your contribution will come either through a public display
of your own Individual lifestyle, direction and creations, or by empowering and publicly promoting others
(Gate 1). You are drawn toward what is novel and innovative, and will find yourself attracting other
people's attention to it, like the Gallery owner or art agent. Once you get people's attention, all you can
do is lead by example. If others wish to follow, they will. This is how you quietly impact the Collective
and shift the Tribe's orientation over time. Unless Individuality’s innovative contributions are embraced
and incorporated in some way by the Collective and the Tribe, they will not take hold. The leadership
path of recognizing and displaying what is mutative and unique can be a lonely one as you must first
be recognized, and then invited to publicly display and endorse what you know to be of future value.
Without the invitation, society's attention may be negative. If Gate 1’s creative means of self-expression is
not defined in your chart, you will seek its inspirational qualities, however, your key role is not as the artist
but as the agent who promotes other artists’ vision of the new.

THE CHANNEL OF AWARENESS: 61 - 24
A Design of a Thinker
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Awareness links the Head Center to the Ajna Center
through the Gate of Mystery (61) and the Gate of Rationalization (24).
The mental capacities of the Individual are comprised of the inspiration of
Gate 61, Inner Truth, and the rationalization of Gate 24, The Return. This is
mental definition that brings a sudden experience of knowing, a satori.

ey ; Background: The Channel of Awareness creates the Individual thinker. The
Ze pressure in the Head Center to know the unknowable is conceptualized

through the Ajna Center into a rational answer. Thinking with this channel

is not about discovering — it’s about processing the acoustic mind. It’s about
the mutation that is possible when there is a gap in the thinking process and a new thought can
come in. The mind turns things over, and over again, until the moment of mutation or satori arrives
and you simply know. Individual thinking cannot relate to the past and reflect on it the way abstract
thinking does (Channel 64-47). It cannot recognize the pattern, and based on this measurement
make a prediction for the future as logical thinking does (Channel 63-4). The Channel of Awareness
is here to know what is knowable and of value, to know what is knowable but of no value, and to
know that we are not designed to know everything (the unknowable).

Personal: Your mind is designed to inspire others with your unique knowing, and to offer us the
potential to see life in a completely new way. It is united with something beyond this plane that
you hear and know spontaneously. Your mutative knowing breaks the old abstract cycles, shatters
the logical patterns, and inspires us with a new realization. You don't control your thinking, and you
cannot use your thoughts to get anything or anywhere. You simply need to recognize that ‘knowing’
just happens when it does. The mutation will take place or not. You are here to surrender to the
serendipity of inner truth that will make itself known through the 24th gate, in its own mutative
way, in its own time, while your mind is occupied by the acoustic static, the white noise, of Gate 61’s
inspiration. Yours is truly a mind that is connected to the mystery. Because your mind is always busy
thinking, you both seek and love silence. Listening to or making music often provides a soothing
release from the constant mental pressure to think.

Interpersonal: The real mystery is that inspiration is there in the mind from the beginning, awaiting
its moment of activation or invitation by life itself. Individuals with Channel 61-24 do not have to
‘do’ anything. They simply receive an invitation to focus their awareness mentally, and while absorbed
in that awareness, while absorbed in the moment, a new thought, an unbidden thought, arises and
makes itself known. Knowing happens in its own time. Capturing those illusive but empowering
truths or insights, wanting to convey to others what is truly inspiring and worth thinking about, are
challenges that those with the Channel of Awareness are here to meet. The key to their success is an
ability to distinguish between what is knowable or not, and what needs to be known or not.

GATE 61: INNER TRUTH - THE GATE OF MYSTERY

Center: Head Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of Maia—JC of Thinking — LAC of Obscuration

Gate 61 is the pressure to know, to unravel the mystery, and to inspire with unique moments of
absolute recognition. This knowing moves us toward deeper levels of self-acceptance where we can
embrace what distinguishes us from others. You love to spend time musing, and mentally delving
into the unknown. When you ‘know’ that you have a unique insight, and wait for the right time to
express it, you feel liberated. When your knowing inspires, empowers, or mutates others, you feel
empowered. Compared to the Collective mind, which is either focused on what happened in the
past or predicting what may happen in the future, your Individual mind yearns for silence now, for
all the voices and dialogue to stop. If you give in to the intense pressure, and let the unknown haunt
you, your inspiration can become confused by delusion, leading to deep uncertainty and anxiety. The
secret is to enjoy your thoughts and let your inner knowing, your inner truth, reveal itself in its own
unique timing. Without Gate 24 you are not designed to solve the mystery, but simply to enjoy it.

~The natural and spontaneous process of transformation and renewal —
Center: Ajna Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of the Four Ways — JC of Rationalization — LAC of Incarnation

Gate 24's function is to take the unique inspiration of Gate 61 and turn it into a rational concept
which can eventually be communicated to others. It returns to the same territory over and over again,
pondering a thought it considers inspiring, reviewing it until it can be brought into form. Your mind
cannot act on the inspiration, however, or prove it logically or through past experience. This is a natural
and spontaneous process of transformation, mental renewal and unique knowing. One moment the
knowing is not there and the next moment it is. To use your individual mind to your greatest advantage,
give yourself time to return and review. This process can include watching or listening to something
over and over again. If you let your mind transform organically, without attempting to control it, the
resolution will often appear on its own. You will hear it ina moment of silence, like those aha’s that pop
into your mind in the middle of the night. Gate 24 is the fear of ignorance, which is the mental anxiety
that you will never know for certain, or that you won't be able to explain your knowing. If you try and
make decisions with your mind, you will trigger this anxiety. Without Gate 61 you are under pressure
to make not-self mental decisions to look for the next inspiring mystery to solve.

THE CHANNEL OF STRUCTURING: 43 - 23
A Design of Individuality (from Genius to Freak)
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Structuring links the Ajna Center to the Throat through the
Gate of Insight (43) and the Gate of Assimilation (23). The inspired knowing
and rationalizations of Channel 61-24 are received by Gate 43 where they
spontaneously break through as insights which the 23rd Gate assimilates
and expresses. Empowerment and evolutionary change are possible when
new perspectives and innovative thinking are clearly explained and accepted.

Background: When the mind is connected to the Throat Center through
this Individual channel, it engages in a mutative and metamorphic process
that empowers efficiency. ‘The Channel of Structuring conceptualizes and
expresses a unique and original perspective in a way that changes how people see and think. Using
keynotes, for example, is an ultra-efficient way to say something. For empowerment and change
to take effect, however, the magic of Strategy and Authority is required. If those with this channel
do not wait for proper timing, their unique knowing, no matter how well expressed, will rarely be
of value to or understood by others. All outer mental authority responds to the natural flow that
results when expression follows Strategy and Authority.

Personal: Your challenge is to simply let go of control, and allow your mind to process its knowing in its
own way and timing. All you can do is develop a proficiency for explaining what you know simply and
clearly. As you do so, the opportunities to express your unique insights, your own genius, will naturally
arise out of others’ recognition of your gifts. There is no need, or even real ability, for you to plan what you
will say beforehand. It is not necessary to know why your mind says what it says, or attach significance to
when it says it. Your mind is here to embrace not only your knowing, but to explore what isn’t known. You
are someone whose thinking feels like it is light years ahead. In order for your genius to be embraced, you
must be aligned with the flow of your unique design. When you correctly share your insights with others,
by waiting for the appropriate timing through your Strategy and Authority, you will not be perceived
as a freak as this recognition allows your Individual knowing to penetrate and mutate the Collective or
Tribe. When your timing is off, however, you will be dismissed, feel alienated, and at times may even
reject your own unique knowing. Expressing your outer authority is a process. It takes time to learn how
to communicate your innovative thinking, and people dont shift easily. You may have to explain yourself
many times before the new concept takes hold and your genius is truly recognized.

Interpersonal: The gift of the Channel of Structuring is the ability to develop techniques and
concepts that enhance efficiency. This mind can look at the way something has been done, or is being
done, and suddenly know a much better and faster way of doing the same thing. This innovative
thinking results in quantum leaps that can move entire organizations to higher planes of efficiency,
and potentially bring a new level of refinement and wisdom into the world. In order to stay in
integrity with their inner knowing, however, those with this channel can appear very deaf to others
(see Gate 43). “The Individual mind will always feel like an outsider standing at the door, waiting
for the invitation to offer its unique knowing.” - Ra Uru Hu

RAC of Explanation — JC of Insight - LAC of Dedication

Gate 43 is the gate of the inner ear and only listens to its own unique inner voice. It transforms
rational inner knowing into Individual insight through spontaneous breakthrough to a new
perspective. Your knowing is not backed up by facts, however, and it can take fortitude to stand
behind and explain insights that seem freakish and completely outside of the Collective or Tribal
norms. You have the capacity, when the timing is right, to mentally mold a unique and mutative
awareness into its final shape. When fully conceptualized, your insights need to be invited down to
Gate 23 in the Throat to bring the potential mutation, the possibility of a new perspective, out into
the world. Nothing is more difficult for you than to listen to and really hear others. It’s not your
fault, nor a problem to be fixed, but simply your genetic protection from undue influence. Gate 43
carries a fear of rejection. You may experience mental anxiety that you will not be able to explain
your ideas, or that they are too weird and will be rejected. Without Gate 23 there is the dilemma of
how to express your breakthrough.

Gate 23 is where inspiration as inner knowing is finally translated into language. Its amorality,
acceptance of diversity, and ability to cut through mental intolerance opens the way for mutation
to take hold in the world. Expression through the Gate of Assimilation initiates us into new
ways of thinking. Here your unique voice can finally say, “I know.” What you know, or don’t
know, will always attract the attention of others, but can also keep you on the outside looking
in. Insights that are potentially different, and transformative, require that you communicate
their essence clearly. If your unique perspective is truly to be of value to others, you must wait
for the right timing to speak, and explain it in a simple and accessible way. If you don’t, you
will be dismissed as a freak. It is also important that you speak only what you truly know. Over
time, your genius will be recognized and you will earn the respect of others. Without Gate
43’s conceptualizing there is mental anxiety that what you say may not be clear, and will be
misunderstood or rejected.

THE CHANNEL OF STRUGGLE: 38 - 28
A Design of Stubbornness
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Struggle links the Root Center to the Splenic center through
the Gate of the Fighter (38) and the Gate of the Game Player (28). This
channel is about the struggle to find meaning and a purpose for living, as
well as the capacity to find meaning and purpose in life’s struggles. Gate 28
brings the awareness of whether struggle is appropriate, or not, and discerns
what has value and is therefore worth fighting for. Gate 38 is the pressure
to preserve individual integrity — to fight against or to oppose outside forces
that would take one away from the true self.

Background: Channel 38-28 brings the realization that elevates Homo
sapiens above their primitive ancestors, namely there is more to life than just staying alive. Powered
by adrenalized Root Center energy, it is designed and equipped to seek and find a purpose, and
chooses to engage whatever gives meaning to existence, no matter how difficult the struggle.
Knowing how to struggle, and which struggles to engage in, is vital to the individuation process.

Personal: You have the stubborn determination to go your own way in life against even the most
overwhelming odds, and to discover meaning and a purpose in the struggles you meet along your
unique path. There is nothing more satisfying or healthy for you, when correct, than to stubbornly
stand up against the odds, or risk losing your sense of security, to fight for a cause you feel is
worthwhile. This form of struggle gives your life meaning, and your unique struggles become
examples which prod and empower others, encouraging them to struggle with the need to pursue
their own individuation process and deeper life purpose. This is not always comfortable for you
or well received by others, so rather than letting your mind choose your battles, you need to be
initiated through your Strategy and Authority into struggles that have value for you. Internal
stress builds when you cannot adequately explain or correctly live out the struggles you have
engaged in, and creates an excess of energy in the body. Regular exercise releases that pressure
so that it can move through you. This is not only healthy for you physically, but keeps the critical
connection with your intuitive awareness clear.

Interpersonal: Channel 38-28 is the driving mutative force compelling individuation towards its
ultimate expression of uniqueness. By stubbornly listening to their awareness in the now, those
with this channel bring mutation in the form of a change of direction to the status quo. It is a
struggle to convince people that evolution is an on-going process, and one worth struggling for. But
the Channel of Struggle is also the channel of stubbornness, rooted in adrenalized energy and a
determination to live the individuated life to its fullest.

‘The 38th gate exerts pressure on you, and those around you, to discover the value of one’s own life.
‘There must be a reason to exist, a purpose, and something to love that elevates struggle beyond
simply surviving. Backed by the energy to oppose, you are capable of forcefully confronting adversity
itself. You actually enjoy a good fight. Purpose for you is enhanced when you stand up for those who
can't stand up for themselves, if it is correct for you to do so. Others might experience this energy in
you as a fierce independence, a highly focused stubbornness to meet a challenge, even death, head
on. In truth, you are simply seeking a reason for living. Your determination to persevere empowers
others to discern for themselves which individuating struggles have value or not. To know what is
worth fighting for, and to avoid wasting energy by engaging in battles that are not correct for you,
you look to the awareness potential of Gate 28. Since Gate 38 is one of the three gates of deafness
that protects your individuality from being influenced by others, you preserve your personal integrity
by opposing those forces that would compromise you.

Gate 28's deepest fear is that life might end before one knows what makes it worth living, or what
gives it meaning. It’s an energy that is stubbornly focused on listening with awareness in order to
best intuit which risks will make you feel more alive, and lead to struggles which bring purpose to
existence. With your Splenic awareness constantly alerting you to danger, you are willing to take
risks others wouldn't, to play games with life and death. Ultimately, you will spontaneously meet
and confront your own fears of death one at a time. You have the energy needed to redirect the self-
absorbed nature of people with Channel 57-20 by prodding them to make their intuitive knowing
available to you and to others. Your own awareness helps people with Gate 38 determine who or
what they should invest their energy in, enabling them to better assess the health and safety factors
for whatever they consider worth fighting for. Without Gate 38, you may fall victim to unnecessary
pressure to fight or struggle, experiencing needless resistance and exhaustion. You look to people
with Gate 38 for clues about what they have discovered makes their life’s struggles worthwhile.

THE CHANNEL OF THE BRAINWAVE: 57 - 20
A Design of Penetrating Awareness
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of the Brainwave links the Splenic Center to the Throat
= Center through the Gate of Intuitive Clarity (57) and the Gate of the
" Now (20). This is where intuitive insight is given its clearest voice in the
now moment. One of the most extraordinary capacities that humans have,
via this channel, is the penetrating self-recognition of the truth of our
existence, which is expressed as, “I know I am alive now.”

Background: In Channel 57-20, Splenic intuition travels directly to the Throat
Center in a wave of knowing that races to be communicated in the moment.
‘This is Individual insight that comes from a deep intelligence or acumen that
is based in our ancient instincts, and connected to the immediate moment's intuitive knowing. The
Channel of the Brainwave’s most profound function is to empower others toward awakening their
own innate survival intelligence. The Splenic Center is the core of our health and well-being. It is
not an energy resource, however, and while our intuition can be aware of and articulate strategies that
enable our well being, it’s not necessarily able to follow through with action.

Personal: Life entices you to use your intuitive awareness to support your own well being in the now,
and to speak the truth, your truth, that arises in each present moment. “I am what I am, and I know how
to be what I am.” With your inner knowing guiding your acute vibratory or acoustic awareness, you will
often find that your spontaneous verbal outbursts of pure intuition get to the core or truth of a situation
much more quickly than those around you. This is the ability to “think on your feet,” and it gives you a
mutative potential which, if your timing is correct, can have a deep impact on the people around you.
Your alertness to the receptivity of others, guided by your Strategy and Authority, allows you to share
your existential knowing with them as true wisdom, and reduces misunderstanding and resistance.

When you are finely attuned, and firmly anchored in the now, you are connected to your ability to
survive. From this perspective, there is no fear of tomorrow. You are one who simply knows what to
do without having to think about it. Your intuitive knowing and body move in one spontaneous wave
of energy. Connecting in to the Channel of the Brainwave's adaptability requires overcoming a fear of
the unknown by learning to listen to, act on, and trust your intuitive impulses completely, moment by
moment by moment. If you ignore these instinctual impulses, the momentary awareness will pass and
you may suffer for it. Maximization of this ability to penetrate into and know in the moment, however,
is dependent on focusing your attention on the present. This focus makes it difficult to hear what
others ‘know,’ which is another way of saying that you don't like being told what to do.

Interpersonal: Gate 57 has a beneficial relationship with Gate 28 which struggles with fears or questions
about whether life is of value. The 28th gate can get the attention of the 57th gate, and pull it out of its
self-absorption. Its search for meaning in life prods Gate 57, which struggles itself with the uncertainty of
its spontaneous words and actions, to release its intuitive knowing and truths in order to find the answers
the 28th gate seeks. When the timing is correct, those with Channel 57-20 can spark mutative change.

— The extraordinary power of clarity —
Center: Spleen Quarter: Duality ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Penetration —JC of Intuition — LAC of the Clarion

With its clarity of intuitive insight, Gate 57 has the capacity to penetrate to one’s core in the now.
You have a deep inner attunement to sound that is constantly alert to the vibrations coming from
your physical, emotional and psychic environments. Moment by moment your intuition registers a
sense of what is safe, healthy and good for you, and what is not. Gate 57 is the gate of the right ear. If
you want to hear what someone is really saying to you, listen with your intuitively attuned right ear.
You must be alert and focused in the now to hear the messages from your Spleen, or the information
you are getting for survival may be ignored. You may sometimes appear deaf to others, or be accused
of selectively hearing what they have to say, but your intuition is your only guide in determining
what the perfect behavior is that will insure your well-being. The only way you will alleviate your
fears for the future is to pay close attention to your instinctual hunches, to that little voice that only
speaks once and softly, and act on these hunches immediately. When you are listening and paying
attention to your intuition now, there is no tomorrow to fear.

GATE 20: CONTEMPLATION - THE GATE OF THE NOW
— Recognition and awareness in the now which transforms understanding into right action —
Center: Throat Quarter: Civilization Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of the Now- LAC of Duality

Gate 20 is a purely existential gate that keeps you focused in the present, and supports your capacity
to survive as yourself. When your expression is properly timed, awareness will be transformed into
words or actions that can impact people around you. This energy frequency is, and must be, totally
absorbed in the present moment. It can give voice to Gate 57’s intuitive survival awareness, to Gate
10's behavioral patterns and commitments to higher principles, or it can manifest Gate 34’s sacral
power through action toward individuation. Gate 20 expresses the full range of being in the moment
from “I am now” to “I know I am myself doing now,” but it does not consider the past or the future.
To be awake and aware, and to survive, you must be fully present to the moment and authentically
yourself. There is rarely time to mentally consider or control what comes bubbling up from inside
of you, so what you say or what you do is suddenly there for everybody, including you, to witness.
In fact, you often see when you are not looking, or hear when you are not listening. This is how the
potential for evolutionary change hidden in each moment of existence is empowered within you.
As you live by your Strategy and Authority, you become a living example. Your intuitive knowing,
personal survival and mutative, self-loving behaviors influence or empower others.

THE CHANNEL OF EMOTING: 39 - 55
A Design of Moodiness
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Emoting links the Root Center to the Solar Plexus Center
through the Gate of Provocation (39) and the Gate of Spirit (55). Prone
to melancholy and uncertainty, provocative and emotional, the pulsing on/
off wave of moods is set in motion here. The emotional wave underlying
the passion and melancholy of Individualism is a mechanic, an endless
continuum between happiness and sadness.

Background: The Channel of Emoting is defined as a provocation to empower
spirit awareness. We are all subject to the moodiness of this channel, a profound
and creative force behind mutation on the planet, until 2027. Moodiness best
describes this rather flat Individual emotional wave with its shifting spikes
of highs and lows, its ecstatic moments of pleasure, and melancholic moments of uncomfortable
uncertainty and sadness. We are not designed to give reasons for any of the moods, but rather to live
within the alchemy of the mutative pulse. By living authentically, and fully embracing the emotional
wave, those with this channel will plumb the depths of their own spirit and truth. “True spirituality
arises out of correctness.”— Ra Uru Hu. Spirit finds its balance when one perceives that the cup is both
half empty and half full, both being emptied and being filled.

Personal: You know how to tease out and discern the nature of an individual's or a group's spirit. You
can tell which people are right for you by the interplay between you and them, and by whose spirit
or mood is in resonance with yours. It is also how you get what you want or need from others. One
can be provoked to experience pleasure instead of pain, joy instead of sadness. Over time, you learn
how to tease and provoke the desired spirit out of others, and find the ones that are correct for you.
At the same time, your provocation opens people up to the infectious, mutative qualities you carry
as an Individual, and can bring out something new from them as well. The impact you have, and the
spirit you provoke, depends on your mood or where you are in your own emotional wave. To bring
out the right spirit, you must be in the right mood. You are not a victim of your moods, however, and
should not make others victims either. You are well served by the recognition that there is a correct
mood or time for everything in life. When not in the mood to socialize, you can enjoy time alone
in the company of your inner muse. This time spent with self connects you to the mature emotional
creativity, depth, and truth that are yours alone to bring into the world.

Interpersonal: When those with the Channel of Emoting, with growing awareness and authenticity,
free themselves to embrace the full range of their emotions and emotional impact, they can lessen the
potential for emotional tension in relationships. Individual’s should never make love, eat, work or play if
not in the mood. If they force themselves to do something when not in the mood, they will not experience
the pleasure they seek, and will greatly diminish their potential to impact and empower others with a
spirited passion for living. When depth of feeling is lived authentically, it transmits a seductive warmth
or passionate sadness that is often expressed through music and art, or acted out on stage, including the
stage of life. If not embraced in a healthy way, moodiness can become manipulative and obsessed with
pleasure. Those with Channel 39-55 may turn to sex, food or drugs to compensate for their melancholy.

GATE 39: OBSTRUCTION - THE GATE OF PROVOCATION
— The value of obstruction in provoking analysis, assessment and re-evaluation —
Center: Root Quarter: Civilization ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of Tension —JC of Provocation — LAC of Individualism

Gate 39, fueled by the Root Center, is the pressure to provoke the evolving emotional awareness of spirit
into revealing itself. Emotional awareness is humanity's destiny, but it is the Individual through the 39th
gate that provokes the mutative potential within the 55th gate to release the spirit consciousness of the
Solar Plexus Center. You have the energy to persevere through your moods and tap into spirit awareness.
Your provoking reveals whose spirit is correct for you. If you are merely a source of irritation to them, they
are not right for you. People may react negatively to your provocation, but this is your unique gift, even
though you may have to develop a thick skin to live with it. Provoking is also the way you get in touch
with and work out your own feelings; if you are in bad mood, you may elicit misery from others. It takes
time to learn who can be successfully provoked or not, and you can only impact the Collective or the
Tribe, and release true mutation, when in the right spirit or mood yourself. This is what makes mutation
contagious, and moves the potential for awareness through the totality. The 39th gate is one of three gates
of deafness, and you are not designed to be easily influenced. Without the 55th gate’s ability to release
emotions, Root Center pressure may provoke you into excesses, like substance abuse or an eating disorder.
Patience with yourself, and your wave, is required for your journey toward spirit.

GATE 55: ABUNDANCE - THE GATE OF SPIRIT
— Abundance is strictly a question of spirit —
Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of Moods — LAC of Spirit

Awareness of spirit is not a concept (Ajna) or instinct (Spleen) — it is an emotion (Solar Plexus). Abundance
is a function of spirit and how you perceive what you are feeling, and the mood you are experiencing in
the moment. The 55th gate is susceptible to the melancholic chemistry of the emotional wave, which is
constantly moving through cycles of hope to pain. One moment your cup feels half empty and the next it
feels half full. Your moods determine what is correct for you and when. If you are not in the mood to eat,
work, make love, be sociable or create, it is not healthy for you to do so. When you feel like being alone, don't
attempt to explain or excuse yourself; simply honor the mood and embrace being in the moment with your
own creative inner self. Your most creative time is when you feel deeply melancholic. A thoughtful word to
those around you when you are simply not in the mood to be social will help them to not personalize the
emotional energy that they are feeling from you. You are open to people with Gate 39 provoking you so that
you can perceive your spirit, and your moods, for yourself. At any given point in your wave, how your spirit
feels and emotes is not open to comparison, debate or influence by others. Spirit awareness arises out of the
wonder that the cup exists at all. What you fear most is emotional emptiness or a lack of passion in life.

THE CHANNEL OF OPENNESS: 22 - 12
A Design of a Social Being
Circuit: Knowing Channel Type: Manifested

; The Channel of Openness links the Solar Plexus Center to the Throat

ay Center through the Gate of Openness (22) and the Gate of Caution (12).
Openness in Channel 22-12 is dependent on the ebb and flow of the
emotional wave or mood. It creatively voices or acts out the moodiness,
melancholy, passion, romance and drama of the Individual emotional wave.
There is a quality of restraint in the 12th gate that governs the 22nd gate’s
openness, limiting it to social interactions with people who appear to have
the most mutative potential.

Background: ‘The literally miraculous qualities of articulation, that
developed through the mutation of the larynx (Gate 12) 85,000 years ago, set the stage for humans
to not only communicate their intelligence, but to emotionally impact others with the quality of
their voice. The social channel of Individual circuitry, the Channel of Openness is guided by a
“when I am in the mood” orientation (emotional wave) that is not focused on being either social
or friendly. Individuals are generally less interested in mating (Tribal) or sharing (Collective) than
they are in creating a receptive environment for their potential to bring a transformative new
awareness to the Collective and the Tribe. The key for people with this manifesting channel is to
wait until they feel like interacting socially. If forced into social situations when on the low ebb
of their wave, they can be misunderstood, become angry and abrupt, and fail to empower others.
Such social failures, repeated over time, can lead to anti-social behaviors and isolation.

Personal: With your keen sense of timing, and an awareness of your audience’s openness, you know
when to use your warmth and social skills to get people’s attention, as well as how to get close
enough to them for your words to be a catalyst for loving change in their lives. You use the quality
and inflection in your voice to move or touch people in order to educate, mutate and communicate.
When your mood and timing are in sync, you can empower others to vicariously experience love’s
full range of emotions through mediums such as public speaking, acting, poetry or music. The Solar
Plexus is your authority so it is imperative that you do not act impulsively. The measure of patience
you cultivate, and the creative depth of feelings you allow yourself to experience by listening through
your wave, determine how powerful your Individual mutative impact will be in the world.

Interpersonal: Individuals are naturally different from everyone else so they tend to attract a great
deal of attention. Consequently, they contend with the fear of being observed, and fear that their
uniqueness may be found strange and lead to rejection by others. Gate 22 hears with the left ear
and these Individuals hear what they feel like hearing. For them to know something fully, it must
be repeated and heard over time. They have the capacity to really listen and hear what is being said
which makes them true listeners — when in the mood. When their social interactions are guided by
their mood, barriers come down and their fears dissipate. It is in this environment of social openness,
this existential moment where it all comes together, that the magic of the Individual’s mutative
difference has its full impact.

GATE 22: GRACE - THE GATE OF OPENNESS
— A quality of behavior best suited in handling mundane and trivial situations —
Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Initiation ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Explanation —JC of Insight — LAC of Dedication

Gate 22 combines the potential for emotional openness through listening, with a social grace and
charm that is highly attractive to others, when it is in the right mood. When its mood changes,
however, a dramatically different and sometimes antisocial side of you may be experienced. Your
unique emotional awareness comes to you over time as you move into your depths along the
emotional wave. By allowing your depth or truth to mellow with age, in the company of your
creative muse, you refine your ability to know the correct timing for when society is ready for you
to release your truth. Recognizing and acting on that timing is dependent on honoring your mood
swings. Your openness, and your attentiveness to what is essential and new for others, are gifts of
grace which even impact strangers. You listen to others until they complete what they are saying,
making what you have to say naturally come second. This is grace in action, as well as the key to your
own empowerment. In fact, it is your responsibility and privilege to use your social listening skills in
a way that makes change available to others. Without the 12th gate, you may know what you feel,
but not how to express it verbally. Because silence makes you nervous, what you fear most is that
there is nothing worthwhile to listen to.

GATE 12: STANDSTILL - THE GATE OF CAUTION
~The quality of restraint and the importance of meditation and inaction in confronting temptation —
Center: Throat Quarter: Civilization Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of Eden —JC of Articulation — LAC of Education

The articulate, mutative and moody voice of the Individual is restrained in Gate 12 by a natural
caution. This caution keeps you silent until your mood tells you that you really do have something
to say, as well as a unique, transformative way of saying it. The vocal vibration or tone of your voice
speaks louder than your choice of words. Standing still, or contemplating a unique perception or
feeling until in the mood to express it in a creative way, through poetry or music for instance, gives
your message time to mature. You have your greatest impact on others as a “stranger of consequence;”
like a performer, you translate and creatively express the joys and sorrows of loving and living, and
then you withdraw. When you are not in the mood, chances are your audience won't hear what
you want them to, or will not experience the transformation or inspiration that interacting with
you can bring. Impeccable timing maximizes the potential impact you can have on social/cultural
norms, and on our way of being with each other in the world. You know how to express yourself, but
without the 22nd gate you can’t always clarify what it is you are feeling.

‘The Centering Circuit is one of two smaller but important minor circuits in the BodyGraph. Channel
34-10 transforms the way in which one lives in the world while the other side, Channel 51-25,
transforms the way in which one takes advantage of the world we live in. The Centering Circuit is
centered on the G Center and the identity and direction of the self. It is focused on empowering
people to love themselves, and to follow their own unique path in life by living according to their
Sacral’s response. Simply by doing what is correct for them, these beings inspire and empower others
to be themselves.

People who are healthy and authentic on the inside are able to inspire the world around them to
be healthy. Only the centered, integrated self, through its living example, has the power to bring
mutation to the Collective and the Tribe. Without ongoing mutation there can be no evolution on
any level. Those with definition in the Centering Circuit who are not able to be a force for healthy
change in others’ behavior will often become melancholic and lonely. If, however, they let their
Strategy firmly align and ground them within their unique design, they can be a profound and
empowering example of self love and the fully-individuated, authentic life.

You will notice that there are no awareness centers present in this circuit, nor the Head, Throat or
Root Centers. This circuit is completely about being centered as a response to life.

‘The Channels and Gates of the Centering Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
494 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF EXPLORATION: 34 - 10
A Design of Following One's Convictions
Circuit: Centering (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Exploration links the Sacral Center to the G Center through
the Gate of Power (34) and the Gate of the Behavior of the Self (10). Gate
10 initiates behaviors (as roles) from deep inside of us that lead us to accept,
honor and love ourselves. Gate 34 provides the sustaining power or inner
strength to stand by the convictions that form our belief in and acceptance
of ourselves. Gate 34’s pure energy for self empowerment and individuation
only interacts correctly with others through sacral response.

Background: Channel 34-10 powers the exploration and perfecting of the
personal behaviors needed to survive in society. Those with Channel 34-
10 are here to love themselves, and to trust their inner convictions explicitly when guided by their
Sacral response and personal Authority. As the creative channel for the Centering Circuit, it exerts its
influence over all other circuitry in the design. This is not energy to be imposed on others, however,
but rather to be focused creatively on ways to remain centered on the convictions that are correct for
the Individual. This focus leads to a level of self mastery that empowers even those with strong Tribal
connections to love and honor themselves, despite the Tribe's strong emphasis on loving and serving
the community first.

Personal: You are here to follow your own convictions no matter how unusual they are, to behave
independently and as yourself despite interference. The guidance and timing of your Sacral’s responses
are what make it possible to do this in satisfying ways, and without guilt. By living authentically, you
demonstrate for others the benefits of perfecting self-loving, interactive behavior through response.
‘This empowers them to get in touch with their own conviction to love themselves. Your enveloping
Generator aura, combined with the Channel of Exploration, can attract a great deal of attention.
Whether or not this attention is positive, with its true potential for empowerment and mutation
that only Individuality can bring into the world, is completely dependent on your willingness to
patiently attune to your responses. You, and those around you, will be quick to recognize when you
are living the opposite: a rigid and unsatisfying not-self expression of this channel which can sound
selfish and self-centered as in, “I’m going to be like this whether you like it or not. You can be any
way you please, just don’t interfere with me and my way.”

Interpersonal: The Centering Circuit is designed to empower independence and self-reliance, based
on self love, in those who interact with it. The Channel of Exploration describes the kind of world
Individuals would most like to be a part of, where everybody is able to live their uniqueness without
dealing with resistance and interference from others. As an electromagnetic definition between
two people, the channel brings an Individual flavor to relationships, which can lead to the breaking
of old molds or traditions in its quest to explore new territory. If people with strong Collective or
‘Tribal ties are joined together by this connection but do not understand the power of response, their
relationship could provide some unexpected challenges.

GATE 34: THE POWER OF THE GREAT - THE GATE OF POWER
— Power is only great when its display or use serves the common good —
Center: Sacral Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix — JC of Power— LAC of Duality

Gate 34 is a potent and impressive source of energy that empowers us toward individuation,
displaying and celebrating our uniqueness in the world. Two qualities distinguish this gate from the
other eight in the Sacral: its asexuality and the unavailability of its power to others. If connected
to Gate 10 in your G Center, your energy will be focused on social behaviors or roles that support
your strong convictions. If connected to Gate 20 in your Throat, your power will be resolved to act
on your own behalf, to turn your thoughts into deeds, and to express your ability to manifest and
thrive. If connected to Gate 57 in your Spleen, your intuition will empower your ability to hear what
you need to survive perfectly in each moment. Without the Spleen's direct intuitive guidance, this
relentless power to act may become an unhealthy, meddlesome and misdirected energy, and you
may feel lost in your own momentum, expending energy that serves no one. Though admired, and
even sought after, your energy is simply not available to others. It must remain pure in its power, and
always accessible to you as you seek to be independent and unique, to act on your convictions, and
to triumph, which means to survive as yourself.

Gate 10 is the most complex gate in the G Center, and one of the four Gates of the Incarnation Cross
of the Vessel of Love. This is the gate of the love of oneself. The six potential behaviors or roles of the
self (listed below) are guided by the intuition of Gate 57, empowered by the Sacral response of Gate
34, and manifested or expressed through Gate 20. Within the framework of these roles, humanity
is now exploring what it means to live as a 9-centered, self-aware form with its potential to awaken,
and to experience genuine self love. With your Strategy and Authority in place, Gate 10 empowers
your potential to surrender to living authentically as yourself: As you come to know, accept and love
what makes you unique, you empower others to love themselves as well. True awakening through
surrender is not a commitment to becoming something; it is a commitment to being yourself. Gate
10's strong emphasis on loving self-acceptance will deeply impact how humanity moves through the
21st century. You are one who recognizes that awakening is not possible without self-acceptance.
As you embrace the honor and pleasure of exploring life in a self-aware form, you empower our
potential to live as our true selves, awake in the now moment.

THE CHANNEL OF INITIATION: 51 - 25
A Design of Needing to be First
Circuit: Centering Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Initiation links the Heart Center to the G Center through
the Gate of Shock (51) and the Gate of the Spirit of the Self (25). Gate 51’s
competitive, need-to-be-first ego energy is connected to Gate 25’s universal
love, and the ability of the higher self to see and love the beauty in the
animate and inanimate equally.

Background: In Channel 51-25, initiation becomes an art. This is the ability to
recognize a person's potential for individuation and, when invited, to provide
the ‘shock’ which initiates and empowers them toward it. There is a natural
competitiveness in this channel that challenges humanity to move ahead, be
first or win, which has transformed the material, mundane world we live in. This is the only channel of
the Ego Circuit that is not a part of the Tribal Circuit, yet it represents the deep relationship that exists
between the Tribe and the Individual. Both channels of the Centering Circuit (Channel 34-10 is the
other) are powerful mutative forces exerting pressure on humanity to continue to evolve consciousness
more deeply into form. Self mastery and mastery of the world go hand in hand.

Personal: It is your nature to be competitive, and you may arouse and empower competitiveness in
others. If entered into correctly, competition stretches, tests and even pushes you to transcend your
normal creative limits and the barriers of physical endurance. Each breakthrough brings exhilaration
and a new awareness of the depth of your own spirit. With each triumph comes a personal, even
mystical, sense of your uniqueness which in turn becomes an example of courage for others to
follow. You may even find yourself empowering organizations with your gutsy ways of achieving
personal goals. It must be remembered, however, that initiating individuation is a mystical process
at the heart of mutation, and cannot be controlled. If it is your destiny, it will be a by-product of
living true to yourself. If you seek initiation you will not find it; initiation must find you so that you
can surrender to it. If you seek to initiate others without their invitation, they may fail, leaving you
resentful and unfulfilled. Your Strategy and Authority are the most powerful mystical tools you have,
along with the understanding that to survive the initiating shocks you will meet along the way, you
must tend to the needs of your heart, both physically and metaphysically.

Interpersonal: Initiation toward individuation takes a person from “we are” to “I am.” True shamans
are specially gifted innocents who are able to survive the quantum leap into the void (the unknown)
that such individuation and transcendence requires. They then artfully initiate others into deeper levels
of self awareness. Whether one leaps as a courageous warrior or as a fool matters not; landing will be a
shock in either case. Initiation or shock can come through an ‘invitation that is not of our own choosing,
like an auto accident. Life itself is the most profound mystical force of initiation for empowering a
change of behavior or direction that we can encounter. Those with the Channel of Initiation are here to
feel the wonder of their own unique spirit (higher self) and, in the process, to empower and mutate the
Collective and the Tribe. Living from their center through Strategy and Authority, perfectly aligned
with their unique geometry, is what allows those with Channel 51-25 to not only meet but also survive
these transcendent encounters with the forces of universal consciousness.

GATE 51: THE AROUSING - THE GATE OF SHOCK
~The ability to respond to disorder and shock through recognition and adaptation —
Center: Heart Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Penetration —JC of Shock — LAC of the Clarion

Gate 51, the Gate of Shock, is the energy for Individual initiative. Backed by the ego's will and courage, it
embodies the power to compete, driving you to be one step ahead of everybody, and to risk going where
no one else has gone in order to find or create a place for yourself. You are designed to withstand shock
and to shock others, to move them out of the complacency of their safe cocoons and direct them toward
personal transcendence and self love. Love for life itself, and the constant competition that comes with
mastering the material world, arouses and empowers you. In opposition to the courage and will power
that energizes you, however, is a potential for foolhardiness that endangers your vulnerable heart, both
physically and spiritually. The secret to maintaining your heart's health is to center yourself by attuning to
your Strategy and Authority, and sense within when you have the will to engage in battle, and when you
don't. This guidance will allow you to adapt to the nature of any shock or disorder confronting you, and
give your heart the rest it needs in order to recuperate from your engagement with the world. Without
Gate 25 you may find yourself seeking or looking to the realm of spirit for guidance or direction.

RAC of the Vessel of Love —JC of Innocence — LAC of Healing

‘The love of Gate 25 flows out of fully accepting and living surrendered to one’s form. A gate of the
higher self, its pivotal role is to turn people toward individuation. Your innocence is not designed to
bring love into the world in any specific way, but rather to love without discrimination. You hold the
potential, and empower others with the potential, to love life and everything in it equally. A flower
can be loved as profoundly as a human. This quality of love is often projected as cool or cold but is
neither. The mystical potential of this love is transcendent and universal, and your spirit innocence is
always being tested. You have the capacity to meet these initiations from life like a spiritual warrior,
fired up and ready to compete for your spirit (your individuality) no matter what the circumstance.
‘Then, when the warrior or “fool” of Gate 51 prods you to leap into the void, or when you meet
life’s initiating challenges, you will be able to land on your feet and deepen your innocence into a
wisdom that can empower others on their own journey. You may emerge a bit wounded from such
initiations, but your ultimate triumph and survival enriches your spirit and the spirit of those around
you. The result is that you are alive with the wonder, the love, of being.

SECTION SIx: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 199

‘The Collective Circuit Group is composed of two major circuits: the Understanding/logic Circuit
and the Sensing/abstract Circuit. Sharing is a part of every channel and gate in the circuit. For the
Collective, sharing is akin to a drive or social obligation or need to tell you what they think, what
they have experienced, or what they have judged to be of value or not. The Collective is quick to share
opinions, dilemmas, solutions, criticism, expectations, fantasies, inventions, medical breakthroughs
and more, but the sharing is not personal. The Collective’s inherently social orientation is objective,
impersonal and not necessarily reciprocal, and it is best to avoid taking the Collective's sharing
personally no matter how personal it feels.

When indiscriminate sharing is expressed unbidden, driven by the not awake and unaware not-
self mind, it can be a real nuisance. For example, those in crisis will catch themselves unwittingly
sharing their situation with the clerk, the postman, or the person next to them at the bus stop.
Learning to wait to be asked to tell their story, or to give their opinion, is part of becoming
sensitive to the receptivity of others, and the key to sharing that is satisfying, effective and
transformative. The mutuality and social nature of humanity, along with its need for harmony
or uniformity, is embedded in the Collective. This circuit group drives consciousness forward by
sharing what has been learned through experimentation and experience. With its focus on society,
the Collective establishes what is good for the majority, as opposed to what is good for any one
specific Individual. The idea that “what is good for one is good for all so stay with the pattern that
works” comes from this circuit group. It might be terrible for you personally, but since it is for the
greater good you put up with it. Citizens of a country for instance all share the same rules, the
same monetary currency and the same public institutions.

Without the Collective's collegiality, majority rule and obligation to share, today’s larger societies
could not stand; they would still be a cluster of fiefdoms competing for the same resources. With
the Collective at the helm in recent history, the educated and privileged classes have entered the
era of the global village. We have nearly reached the ultimate potential and goal of the Collective
Circuit Group. The Collective is suspicious of the nonconforming, impetuous Individual, and it
has never trusted the primitive demand for loyalty and the bargaining of the Tribe.

Notice how the Collective Circuit Group, viewed in the illustration, forms a kind of outer shell and
inner core which appears to both bind and buttress the BodyGraph. There is an unusual balance
and beauty in the opposition that exists within this symmetry. It is like a dance between yesterday
(Sensing/abstract) and tomorrow (Understanding/logic), between cycles and patterns, between
experiencing and proving. Life is built on logic, but lived out through the abstract cycles of life. The
Sensing (abstract) Circuit tries to codify experience or make sense of the past, and the Understanding
Circuit (logic) tries to anticipate the future. The Collective is not as focused on the now moment,
which is the Individual’s contribution. Out of this circuit group's internal opposition, its seesawing
back and forth between past and future, comes its reputation for conservatism or maintaining the
status quo. “If it isn’t broken, don't fix or change it.” A level of stability also emerges from this
circuit group that says with some pride, “I understand. I have the facts. It is like this.” Or, “I have
experienced it. I've been there, done that. All you have to do is listen to me.” Logic is experimental;
it’s about the way things are supposed to work. The abstract Sensing Circuit is experiential, and deals
with desire and the unexpected.

The Understanding Circuit’s theme is logic, a cool-headed but seductive intelligence rooted in the
recognition of patterns through concentration on the details. It analyzes processes or formulas, and
challenges what isn’t working. This logic allows one to predict, with a certain reliability, what can be
expected in the future from this or that course of action.

Understanding takes place over time. It requires financial support, disciplined repetition, and the
development of techniques or skills in order to refine and concretize a pattern, or to master and
perfect an aptitude, a plan or a formula. Together with resources often obtained from outside the
circuit, logic requires practice to reach its potential and make its contribution, part of which is to lead
humanity safely into the future. As long as logic is free from conditioning, it can be used to share
the Understanding Circuit’s formulized hypotheses, its perspectives and projected doubts about the
future, in deeply influential ways.

Unlike its mirror, the abstract and experiential Sensing Circuit, the Understanding Circuit's logic
has no connection to the warmth and passion of the Solar Plexus. The Understanding Circuit is
often referred to as the cool side of the chart, although logic’s stability brings a deep satisfaction not
available to the experiential side. There is collective joy when we can see that one plus one always
equals two, and that the pattern is reliable. When logic works, it is as pleasurable as putting that last
piece of a puzzle into place, which is part of the seduction logic holds for the Collective.

‘The Channels and Gates of the Logic Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
202 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF CONCENTRATION: 52 - 9
A Design of Determination
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Concentration links the Root Center to the Sacral Center
through the Gate of Stillness (52) and the Gate of Focus (9). The 9th gate
is determined to maintain its focus on details and facts, while the 52nd
gate provides a passive fuel that powers this focus by keeping one still and
withdrawn from other distractions. Channel 52-9 creates a potential that
can be fulfilled through focused attention when one is still enough to assess
all of the pertinent aspects.

Background: In order to improve something, and be of service to the world,
logic must be able to sustain its focus and handle all of the details within a
pattern. The Channel of Concentration is a format energy* that carries the qualities of all of the other
channels in the Understanding Circuit. When guided by Sacral response, it influences one’s entire
design with its energy to concentrate on and challenge, correct or perfect any pattern, form or activity
that one is profoundly committed to. Logic is a step by step, one-foot-in-front-of-the-other process,
and one must be deeply identified with the formula in order to spend the
time required to either prove or disprove it. The logical process is immensely
important in sustaining the Collective's position of influence within the whole.

Personal: You are continually involved in assessing the details of whatever
it is that you have dedicated yourself to. You experience a quiet pressure
to be still, not as stress, but more as a tension that keeps you in place, like
a yoga pose. You still your physical body and your outer senses in order to
use your energy in a precise, focused way, and hate dissipating this potent
energy by having to deal with many things at once. You are like the Buddha
sitting under a lotus tree, gathering your energy and waiting for your Sacral Format ENERGY

to respond. Your responses reveal what your focus will be, what pattern you

will be devoted to perfecting, and when to share it. As you follow your responses, your true vocation
and life focus also emerge. You may be profoundly dedicated to one activity for most of your life,
or have multiple, distinctly different foci over the course of a lifetime. With this format channel
defined in your design, you may find yourself restless and depressed if there is nothing worthwhile
to concentrate on, nothing that your Authority says is correct to direct this energy toward.

Interpersonal: Aurically the format frequency of Channel 52-9 can hold, or concentrate, energy in
one place, allowing a group to focus and facilitate a deeper examination of the project or process
under consideration. If you don't have this channel in your design, it may be to your advantage in
certain circumstances to sit next to someone who does in order to heighten your own ability to sit
still and concentrate.

“Format energies exert a powerful influence on all other channels in the circuit, and the design as a whole.
Format Channels run between the Root and Sacral Centers: 53-42 (Collective/Abstract), 60-3 (Individual)
and 52-9 (Collective/Logical). There is no format channel for the Tribal Circuit.

GATE 52: KEEPING STILL (MOUNTAIN) - THE GATE OF STILLNESS
~—Temporary and self-imposed inaction for the benefit of assessment —
Center: Root Quarter: Civilization ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of Service — JC of Stillness — LAC of Demands

Gate 52 is energy under pressure that is focused on assessment, the raw power to concentrate.
‘There is a passive tension in this connection from the Root Center that is looking toward Gate 9
for an outlet. Once the 52nd gate finds something it deeply identifies with, something worthwhile
to channel this energy toward, the tension is balanced between the Root Center’s pressure to keep
you moving forward, and Gate 52’s power to help you sit still and concentrate. Before this balance
is reached, however, you can find yourself vacillating between restlessness and depression, bouncing
from one thing to the next, unable to find the self discipline to withdraw once again into your
stillness and concentrate. There is no physical outlet within Gate 52 that can direct or relieve this
passive tension within you except to focus it. Without Gate 9, and the Sacral response, it is difficult
to know what activity or details to concentrate it on.

RAC of Planning —JC of Focus — LAC of Identification

Gate 9 acts like a funnel, focusing Gate 52’s enormous power to concentrate on what is meaningful
and worthwhile for you. The frequency carried in Gate 9 is a diligence for detail or an ability to focus
your energy. So much about our logical success as a species depends on conserving precious energy
by paying attention to the details. You have the determination to focus the passive but powerful
energy pouring out of the Root Center in one place. With Gate 9’s Sacral capacity to persevere, you
can focus your attention for long periods of time on all the detailed aspects of a project or issue, and
properly test or assess the formulas. All of that can be shared with the Collective or applied to your
own life. Without Gate 52, however, you may not be able to sit still long enough to concentrate.
Your own lack of determination can become a source of frustration for you. When clear and focused,
your aura may facilitate the efficient use of both physical and mental energy in those near you.

THE CHANNEL OF RHYTHM: 5 - 15
A Design of Being in the Flow
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Generated

‘The Channel of Rhythm links the Sacral Center to the G Center through
the Gate of Fixed Patterns (5) and the Gate of Extremes (15). Gate 5 holds
to its fixed habits and rituals, while Gate 15, with its love for humanity's
extremes, levels the playing field by incorporating society’s diversity into the
flow. Here we find the rhythm of life, deeply magical and universal, binding
a all life forms together from the single cell to complex human beings.

Background: The Channel of Rhythm is the cornerstone of all bio-life
processes, intimately connecting us through each response of the Sacral
Center to the flow of the natural world. It is subject to neither the
arrogance of mind nor the highs and lows of the emotional wave. The Magnetic Monopole, with
its singular attraction that holds everything together in the illusion of separateness, is located in
the G Center. The Collective magnetism of the 15th gate is a projection by the Monopole of the
universal (not personal) love of humanity and humanity's potential; in this way it pulls us forward.
Its frequency magnetically draws everyone into its rhythm, as a way of impersonally sharing the
flow of life. This rhythm of life is naturally and fundamentally logical, based on repeatable yet
ever-evolving patterns, and is designed to direct every living thing toward the future.

Personal: You are constantly moved along by the river of life, vitally and intimately connected to its
continuous flow. You appear to others to have your own sense of timing that is determined entirely by
your own inner rhythm. If these patterns or routines are natural and correct for you, then you should
not allow anything to interfere with them. You cannot connect with the patterns of nature’s rhythm if
you flow apart from your inner response because your Sacral guides and fine-tunes your timing. When
aligned with your flow, everything you do feels effortless and natural, and subtly benefits those around
you by bringing them into their own rhythm and timing. If you live the distortions and incorrect
timing of the not-self, however, you may find yourself disrupting everyone's flow, beginning with your
own. Life around you can then feel confusing and chaotic.

Interpersonal: The auric magnetism of this channel is designed to draw people into a continuous
but flexible flow that keeps humanity moving toward a secure and viable future. The Collective's
social flow provides us with unlimited opportunities for bonding. Logic’s ideal pattern is people
flowing together with the opportunity to bond with one another as equals, de-conditioned and
living authentically. Logic confirms that all natural and correct rhythms and patterns, regardless
of how fixed or how extreme, expand the way love is manifested in the world. An electromagnetic
connection between Gates 5 and 15 can be challenging, as one person will be fixed in their pattern
while the other needs to remain flexible within their rhythm’s extremes. When they come together,
however, they experience the Channel of Rhythm’s potential to determine the flow that carries those
around them forward, even an entire group. Channel 5-15 draws others in the environment into its
own flow, and determines the course the group will take.

GATE 5: WAITING - THE GATE OF FIXED PATTERNS
— Fundamental attunement to natural rhythms; waiting as an active state of awareness —
Center: Sacral Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of Consciousness — JC of Habits — LAC of Separation

For Gate 5, waiting isn't stopping; it is an active state, like being pregnant. Gate 5 is an energy
that enjoys fixed rhythms and tempos. This is what gives you the tenacity to stay true to your own
inner rhythms in order to stay vital, healthy and always in your flow. You find great satisfaction in
mundane rituals and routines that attune you to the vibrations of all life. Being forced to deviate
from your natural rhythms can be physically, mentally and emotionally destabilizing for you, and
can manifest as insecurity, unhealthy behaviors or physical disorders. Don't question your natural
routines or rhythm, or let others lure you away from them. For example, a friend with the extremes
of Gate 15 may not understand why you are so compulsive about your rituals and daily patterns.
‘Their rhythm automatically disrupts your healthy routines, and might even tempt you to abandon
them. Conversely, you may find yourself wanting to influence their unpredictability with your fixed
ways. Keep in mind that their flexibility and adaptability, though it feels unpredictable to you, is
what keeps them healthy. Understanding and appreciating what each of you brings to the flow helps
you embrace and transcend the inherent challenges.

GATE 15: MODESTY - THE GATE OF EXTREMES
~The quality of behavior which expresses the proper balance between extremes —
Center:G Quarter: Civilization ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form

RAC of the Vessel of Love — JC of Extremes — LAC of Prevention

Gate 15 is the love of humanity. It has the capacity to accept and to find a place in society for the
full spectrum of human behavior. Its lack of a fixed pattern insures that each of us is able to make
a contribution to the diverse ways love exists in the world. Love in Gate 15 is not about how we
connect with others, but rather how we project a transpersonal love for humanity’s diversity out
into the world. This begins with loving the extremes of your own rhythms; for example, sleeping
ten hours one night, and two hours the next. You are capable of accepting other people’s extremes
without judgment, thereby bringing diversity into the flow of life. The Magnetic Monopole amplifies
your aura’s magnetism which attracts people to you and your acknowledgement of diversity. When
guided by your Authority, Gate 15 increases your potential to influence how extreme rhythms or
patterns are made ‘modest,’ and are balanced and integrated within the Collective. By understanding
and accepting the diverse and opposite tempos that are a part of humanity, you fully embrace and
promote for all of us what it means to be human. Without Gate 5’s disciplined and fixed rhythm,
you may find that your own constantly changing rhythms cause you to lose the focus you need to
achieve mastery in some area of your life.

THE CHANNEL OF THE ‘ALPHA’: 7 - 31
A Design of Leadership for ‘Good or Bad’
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of the Alpha links the G Center to the Throat Center through
the Gate of the Role of the Self (7) and the Gate of Influence (31). This is
the design of logical collective leadership looking towards the future. Logical
leadership is based on tested and established patterns that can be followed
with certainty. The 31st gate is the Collective leader and its voice carries the
quality of influence. The 7th gate provides the logical role needed to lead and
guide society; it is described as the power behind the throne. Its Six Lines
name the leadership roles we most often use when interacting with others,
such as the authoritarian, the general, and the administrator.

Background: As residents of a global community, we are familiar with the Collective's style of
democratic or shared leadership. Alphas are leaders who must first earn our trust. Those who lead by
logic must perfect their leadership skills, and be able to demonstrate them to society's satisfaction.
‘They have to be recognized as people who grasp present patterns, understand trends and are in
touch with the needs of the people. Most importantly, they must be invited (elected) by the majority
to lead. Their length of tenure is determined by the electorate’s evaluation of their performance.
Collective leadership is empowered by majority rule, which differs from the autocracy of the Tribe
or the personal example of the Individual.

Personal: It is said of wolves that not all alphas lead packs, but no true alpha will stay in a pack led by
another alpha. You may not become a community or national leader, but you will naturally seek your
own arena of influence, your own pack. Once you have found it, you can bring attention to qualities
essential to keeping society on the right track, but you can only point the way for others. You cannot
do it for them. Leading from a position of influence rather than one of absolute authority is key to
your success and to maintaining your sense of well being.

Interpersonal: Leadership in this channel is more appropriately described as influence because the
Channel of the Alpha is not connected to a motor, and it is focused on the future. The alpha might
say “doing this or that will work,” but unless the majority is willing to step up and elect you to lead
them to do it, it won't get done. Collective leadership says, “I will represent you and share leadership
with you as long as you are doing what I tell you to do — because I am right.” In other words, those
with leadership definition have a much better chance of success if they are leading the right people
under the right circumstances. They are more successful when they wait to be recognized and invited
by those who share the same Collective context, and are part of the same established pattern. Logic’s
answers are rarely universally correct or long lasting; at any moment the pattern could be challenged
or become weak or break down. It’s all part of perfecting the process, which keeps humanity moving
toward an ever more secure future.

‘The 7th gate is oriented toward the future, with an ability to see when society’s present direction
needs correcting to get there. This is logic’s gate of direction, part of the Right Angle Cross of
the Sphinx. The substance of its contribution to the Collective is expressed through designated
leadership roles which are listed below as the six lines of Gate 7: Authoritarian, Democrat,
Anarchist, Abdicator, General, and Administrator. These roles are genetic and mechanical, and
have tremendous conditioning power within the Collective. Through your role, and with your
understanding of humanity’s future direction, you persuade others to follow your leadership, thereby
influencing people in positions of influence themselves, especially those with Gate 31. You might
be the one to evaluate or modify the existing pattern or questionable direction, or be the catalyst for
creating a new direction. This position of influence is described as the power behind the throne. In
other words, without Gate 31 you can be a public leader but not necessarily the public figurehead
who directly influences the Collective.

GATE 31: INFLUENCE - THE GATE OF INFLUENCE
— The law of friction, whether active or passive, that engenders transference and thus influence —
Center: Throat Quarter: Civilization Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Form
RAC of the Unexpected — JC of Influence — LAC of the Alpha

Gate 31 is designed to be influential. Collective leadership is collegial, not hierarchical. It provides
the vision for a new direction and shows others how to achieve it, rather than doing it for them. The
31st gate manifests its potential for verbal influence through election. When money is the energy
used to move a person into a position of power, instead of the cooperative will of the people, the
Collective's overall ability to ensure humanity’s future is easily perverted. Your voice through the 31st
gate, “I lead,” is not heard until backed by the energy of the majority. The people are the ones who
must act on what your voice says. The influence of your vision for society will not be transferred or
felt without the Collective's energy moving it into the public realm. Your leadership must take into
account the desires of your followers, and address the good of the whole. ‘I lead’ means influencing
others, for good or for ill, by effectively transferring your vision for a new and test-worthy pattern to
them to carry out. Without the presence of Gate 7, you may seem like just an empty voice.

THE CHANNEL OF JUDGEMENT: 58 - 18
A Design of Insatiability
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Judgment links the Root Center to the Splenic Center
through the Gate of Vitality (58) and the Gate of Correction (18). Logic
needs to be able to prove it has the best answers, and underlying the logical
process is an insatiable drive to challenge, correct and perfect any pattern.
Channel 58-18 fuels the art of mastery.

Background: Gate 58 fuels our love of and vitality for life, and pressures us
to want to perpetuate this energy. The insatiability of Channel 58-18 is a
by-product of feeling so wonderful. It is as though Gate 58 says, “more and
better, more and better” as logic’s impulse to keep us alive, while Gate 18, the
Gate of Correction, tempers this impulse by alerting us to what isn't healthy, or is out of balance or
in need of correcting. The Channel of Judgement is like a sentry who judges if what it perceives is
stopping life from being joyous for the Collective. Such judgment is based on testing patterns, and
comparing what is inherently correct and workable with what has worked or not worked in the past.
‘This sense of what needs correcting keeps society on track because Channel 58-18 wants everybody
to find satisfaction in the perfected pattern. The Channel of Judgment’s underlying purpose is the
purpose of Human Design; to reclaim or recover the joy and love that have been lost in living a
homogenized, conditioned life.

Personal: Even for the true perfectionist, perfection can never exist because patterns are subject to
continual change. Your ability to judge, and your desire to correct, are expressed when you become
dissatisfied with or feel the need to challenge something. When this perfecting or correcting process
is made personal, however, and either turned inward or directed at others in relationship, the result is
perceived as constant fault finding or a pervasive dissatisfaction with yourself and life in general. You
will find yourself challenging your mother, father, teachers, governments, anyone and everything. No
challenge is too great for logic to take on or lies beyond your Root-fueled need to perfect the pattern.
When a critical evaluation bursts forth unbidden or uninvited, however, it usually takes the form
of an endless and incessant stream of data, about what is wrong, that no one wants to hear. On the
other hand, what brings you real joy is being asked to share as in, “Is there something wrong here?”
‘Those who ask you are the people who are prepared for and open to your answer.

Interpersonal: To avoid wasting precious energy, and to use your essential gifts wisely, you are advised
to pick your battles with care by first waiting to be asked to share your solution, and by devising
solutions applicable to the collective. In this way, you challenge only what others are most open
and ready to address and potentially correct. Two different ways of squeezing the toothpaste tube
provide a humorous and poignant example of how logic can work effectively to reconcile differences.
Logic says toothpaste should be squeezed from the bottom of the tube. The Individual says they will
squeeze the tube anywhere they please. The reconciling, impersonal and practical Collective solution
was to invent — and share with society — a gadget that dispenses the toothpaste with a press of the
pump. Mutually agreeing to apply the solution restores peace, saving the relationship and probably
many others in the process.

RAC of Service — JC of Vitality - LAC of Demands

Gate 58 has the ability to sense when something is weak or unhealthy. You bring to living a joyful
and compassionate audacity to challenge a pattern or the authority behind it. The pleasure you derive
from sharing your appreciation of beauty, your sense of wonder and your zest for living, naturally
attracts and delights others. To satisfy a driving desire to contribute something of value, you focus
your vitality and joy for life on correcting anything that keeps society from achieving and maintaining
well-being and health. Gate 58 provides the fuel logic needs to test the viability of patterns, formulas,
rhythms and directions that are moving humanity into the future. It is logic’s most precious and highly
coveted energy resource. You often provide the energy that is needed to move people from talking
about something to doing something about it. To channel your energy correctly, to conservatively and
appropriately apply it where it is most needed, you look to people with Gate 18 who are attracted to
you. Their existential awareness helps you focus your energy on determining which improvements
should be made and how to manifest them. Without Gate 18 you can feel desperate to be of service in
some way, and push too hard to figure it out yourself.

Center: Spleen Quarter: Duality ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Service —JC of Correction — LAC of Upheaval

Gate 18 enjoys discovering, naming and challenging what needs correcting. When you experience
dissatisfaction with something, chances are it has lost its vitality. Underneath this dissatisfaction lies a
deep concern for human rights, and for what will keep society healthy and in harmony with itself. Your
gift of critical awareness directs you to the source of a weakness or imperfection, and focuses your thinking
on ways to correct or modify or replace it. It is your way of cleaning out what isn't healthy, or restoring
vitality to something that has been corrupted. Your gift is enhanced by impartial discernment, and logic’s
drive to perfect or fine tune your own skills of critical analysis. Ushering in a new understanding through
identifying what needs correcting is the by-product of the process. Gate 18 also represents the fear of
authority and the challenge to that authority. As a Collective gate, it is designed to point out what needs
to be corrected at the Collective level, but when used at the personal level it tends to backfire. Without
Gate 58's joyful fuel for correction, your dissatisfaction can become merely a constant source of fault

finding. This is especially true if your valuable and crucial awareness is no longer productively focused on
situations, patterns or institutions, but rather on people’s idiosyncrasies and foibles.

THE CHANNEL OF THE WAVELENGTH: 48 - 16
A Design of Talent
Circuit: Understanding (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of the Wavelength links the Splenic Center to the Throat
i Center through the Gate of Depth (48) and the Gate of Skills (16). Gate
- 48 is always on the lookout for vital information, and Gate 16 is always
considering new ways to experiment and perfect its skills. When connected
to the Channel of Judgment (Channel 58-18) with its ability to challenge
and name what isn't working, this Design of Talent can use its depth and
skills to find a potential solution to a problem, or to encourage, correct and
refine something that needs perfecting.

Background: The depth available in Gate 48 is an internal intelligence that
cannot be grasped by the mind, and is only accessible to others when one is surrendered to the natural
instincts of the body. When one is deeply identified with, or practices, a skill that is available in Gate 16,
there is a gradual transformation to precision and excellence that is communicated as talent, or the end
result of perfecting the skill or pattern. A skill can be anything from playing an instrument, to figuring out
a scientific formula, to making your way extraordinarily well in the world. Those with Channel 48-16 who
achieve mastery in any area of the logic process, often serve a wider purpose or improve the lives of others.

Personal: You are designed to combine intuitive depth with repetitive experimentation and practice
as you strive to perfect an intrinsic skill. The key to successfully developing your talent is that you
must be completely identified with something that you love doing as it takes great dedication and
constant repetition to achieve mastery. By bringing your depth to the technical mastery or perfecting
of a skill, you transform or convert your skill to a talent. When your enthusiasm is combined with
a long-term dedication to refining your talent, mastery of the pattern eventually transcends the
pattern itself, freeing you to express your own unique wavelength. At the cellular level, it takes the
body seven years to transcend technique; it may take a lifetime to plumb your depth.

Interpersonal: Those with Channel 48-16 have an innate need to be recognized by others, to be
asked to share their talent, and to be rewarded with resources in order to continue its process of
practicing and perfecting. They may lack direct access to energy resources (motor energy) of their
own. If a parent does not purchase the instruments or provide the music lessons their child needs,
for instance, it is much harder for them to develop their budding talent and the dedication necessary
to perfect their skill. Or to pursue the exploration of patterns on behalf of humanity; patterns that
might prove effective and efficient enough for us to face our future with relative security. Money
is a form of recognition, and talent flowers when it is energized by recognition and materially
rewarded. Developing social skills often helps the artist successfully compete for the monetary
resources necessary to continue perfecting their talent. Channel 48-16 also represents the master
and apprentice relationship. ‘The master shares the expertise achieved through constantly refining
a skill by mentoring or teaching a younger but gifted student. During this phase, the focus is
usually on technique, for talent is often considered 1 percent gift (inspiration) and 99 percent work
(perspiration). In this way, the pattern is passed on and the on-going refinement continues as each
new master adds their own unique perspective and level of artistry to logic’s creative process.

Gate 48 provides a potent awareness, rooted in deep instinctual memory, that gives you the potential
depth to bring logic’s real and workable solutions to the problems of society. More than anything, you
want to express and share your depth in order to help others recognize, correct and perfect the world
we live in. Without Gate 16, however, you may experience feelings of inadequacy, fearing that you
won't be able to explain your solution, or periods of frustration when you realize that you must wait
for your depth to be recognized by others before you can share it. You may become overly concerned
about developing skills you feel you lack. Relaxing into an active (expectant) waiting will usually draw
people to you who will initiate your depth. In this way your potential solutions can emerge naturally
and clearly as a foundation for evaluating, perfecting and mentoring the skills of others.

With Gate 16 you eventually make your mark in the world as a keen critic, skilled performer, or
through your talent and enthusiasm for living. You don't, however, begin life that way. You need to
identify with a skill or skills, dedicate yourself to repetition of the pattern, and focus on practice
until you reach a point of mastery that transcends the skill itself and becomes an art. The world
waits for that moment when the dancer becomes the dance, or when living one’s life becomes its
own masterpiece. You are looking for the perfect way to express your expertise. Without Gate 48
however, you may become self-critical and feel that you don't have the adequate depth. You are also
searching for a source of material support that will allow you to concentrate on perfecting your
talent, your theory, your solution so you can then make it available to the world. You look to people
with Gate 48 to bring their depth and dimension to your skill, as well as to properly direct, correct
and encourage your own disciplined practice.

THE CHANNEL OF LOGIC: 63 - 4
A Design of Mental Ease mixed with Doubt
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Logic links the Head Center to the Ajna Center through
the Gate of Doubt (63) and the Gate of Formulization (4). This is the
doubting mind. Doubt is absolutely essential to logic because logic can
be impeccable in its formulization and still be wrong! Channel 63-4
constantly filters patterns to see if they are consistent or not. The moment
a pattern is inconsistent, pressure intensifies and finally becomes a question
which demands an answer.

Background: The Channel of Logic’s fear takes the form of doubt, and pops
up somewhere between the question and the answer. Such skepticism must
be addressed by logical experimentation leading to proof. There is little room for unsubstantiated
belief. An answer is just an answer until a consistent and reliable, practical and ’provable’ pattern
emerges from it. The Collective fears the mutative impact of the Individual because mutation is
a transformative process that breaks down the patterns. For example, someone with definition in
Channel 63-4 cannot logically accept the truth of The Human Design System without experimenting
with and proving it. It must work to be logical, and it must be logical to work.

Personal: You have an active logical mind that hones in on life with a healthy skepticism. “Is it
going to rain next week? Well, based on typical patterns for this time of year, the current barometric
pressure and cloud cover there is a strong possibility, but...” You are good at posing a question,
looking for recognizable patterns, factoring in current data, and making an educated prediction
about the future in order to serve the collective. Will this or that make us safe tomorrow? You
are always tempted to immediately share both the question and the answer, whether others are
interested and open to you or not. When your busy mind is unable to resolve a question, and release
mental pressure without meeting resistance, you can become anxious. It helps to remember that
because the Channel of Logic is a Collective channel, the pressure to understand the pattern is best
used to benefit others. Since your mind is not designed to answer the doubts and questions you have
about your own life and future, keep it busy thinking about other things.

Interpersonal: As an electromagnetic connection, Channel 63-4 creates a rather pleasant mental link
between two people. Those with Gate 63 want to share their doubts, and those with Gate 4 really enjoy
sharing their solutions. This connection works best, however, when both parties understand that it is the
sharing itself that provides the satisfaction. Gate 63 can't expect the solutions from Gate 4 to necessarily
be useful, nor can Gate 4 expect only worthwhile questions to answer from Gate 63. In the end, using
Strategy and Authority to know when to share ensures a congenial and successful exchange.

GATE 63: AFTER COMPLETION - THE GATE OF DOUBT
~— In the spiral of life, all ends are beginnings —
Center: Head Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Consciousness — JC of Doubts — LAC of Dominion

‘The suspicion or doubt of Gate 63 is merely a pressure; it is the readiness to pay attention to and
question what feels insecure until it can be understood and evaluated in terms of our future security.
Doubt arises when you sense an inconsistency or weakness in the existing patterns moving life
forward. This is an essential ingredient in the understanding/logic process, and logic is the common
thread that flows through and connects all life forms on the planet. The doubt of Gate 63 can be
directed out into the world, or focused inward, inappropriately, on your life and choices. Your doubt
becomes an urgency to formulate a question that addresses something that isn't clear to you. If
you don't get an adequate, logical and workable answer to your question, pressure in the form of
suspicion continues to build. Your focus on the future, with an ability to see patterns that exist in
the present, means that if something appears weak and does not stand up under the scrutiny of
your logic, or if it does not insure society’s future, you will reject it for another pattern. When you
are part of a group engaged in long-term planning, your aura will contribute this pressurized fuel
for formulating an answer to the brainstorming process of projecting possibilities into the future.
Without Gate 4, mental anxiety can arise as your need to have an answer to life’s pressing questions.

Gate 4 applies mental awareness to questions fueled by doubt about the future; it formulates
logic’s answers. Each answer, each formula, is only a potential which must eventually be tested and
substantiated by facts. That means that your answers may be the ones people seek, and they may
not be. You use your mental intelligence and mental awareness to judge what looks suspicious. The
pressure of a doubt or suspicion can last a lifetime, however, and you need to rely on your Authority
to guide you to the correct question(s) on which to concentrate your energies while you wait for
the right timing to share your answers. Ultimately, the answers you formulate are designed to be
applied to questions that come from people around you. Rarely if ever can you formulate answers
that provide solutions to your own questions about your life. Understanding and accepting this truth
can bring the comfort of letting answers come and go in your mind, until the time is right for one to
be brought to the surface by being asked to share it for the benefit of others. If you do not have Gate
63, you may either spend a lot of time looking for the next inspirational question you can answer, or
become anxious that your life will always be in chaos.

THE CHANNEL OF ACCEPTANCE: 17 - 62
A Design of an Organizational Being
Circuit: Understanding Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Acceptance links the Ajna Center to the Throat Center
through the Gate of Opinions (17) and the Gate of Details (62). Logic
influences humanity's thinking processes, and shapes the way humanity reaches
understanding. Acceptance here means mentally organizing information
based on already substantiated detail, and it is an ongoing, internal process.

Sal Background: As the gate of the right eye, Gate 17 visualizes the patterns
while Gate 62 translates them and manifests the detail through words. Gate
62 is responsible for the creation of language, the means by which we name,
organize, evaluate, communicate and give meaning to what we see and
experience. Whatever Channel 17-62 can successfully organize into its own internal picture, it can
understand; what it can’t integrate into its own perspective in this way, it will not understand. Gate
62 is also one of three gates in the design of mammals that connects to humans, in this case with
Gate 17. Such inter-species connections led to the domestication of animals, which in turn led to
the organization of sustainable communities. This particular connection also enhances the training
of animals by connecting them to mind, to higher cognition.

Personal: Your mind is constantly busy organizing details into your own mental filing system,
always making adjustments to your ‘big picture’ by fitting what others think or say into it. This is
how you keep a constant vigil on your internal patterns. All new data has to be logically organized
and integrated to fit your perspective. When you say to someone, “I just don't understand you”
you're simply saying, “I haven't been able to organize my perception of you (or what you are saying
or thinking) in a way that fits into my picture of the world.” With constant pressure on your Throat
Center to speak, you will find you derive satisfaction and a sense of release by sharing your opinions
in great detail, or explaining what you do or do not understand about something. In both instances,
it is particularly important to pay attention to your timing and the receptivity of your audience.
You have a highly sought-after gift for logically organizing things such as business groups, events,
projects and other people's spaces, yet you may not be particularly interested in keeping your own
space neat and in order.

Interpersonal: People with the Channel of Acceptance have a built-in foundation for teaching or
presenting information to others. They have a gift for effectively translating detailed visual patterns
into language, as formulas, theories or hypotheses, so that they can be tested for viability. Waiting
to be invited to speak ensures the successful timing, effectiveness and clarity of their sharing, and
decreases the possibility of meeting resistance or merely boring others with unasked for trivia. Logic
naturally stands its ground. Debate and argumentation, fundamental forms of criticism and friction
that are necessary for logic to scrutinize an existing pattern, remain a common source of stress-
inducing interactions between people, especially if taken personally.

GATE 17: FOLLOWING - THE GATE OF OPINION
— The ancient law that those who wish to rule must know how to serve —
Center: Ajna Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Service —JC of Opinions — LAC of Upheaval

Gate 17 looks for one concept or opinion among many that we can all trust — one that will survive
both testing and criticism, and calm our fears about the future. Gate 17 is designed to structure
an answer into a concept, workable pattern or a possible solution, in preparation for Gate 62’s
substantiating details. Up to this point in the logic process, your mind has taken a doubt about the
future, formulated a potential solution, and now feels pressured to express it as an opinion. What
it needs next is Gate 62’s ability to translate the concept into language, to support it with facts and
details, and present it to the public for their examination and analysis. Your right eye takes in the
world at a glance, seeing it as a collection of recognizable, visual patterns. If a pattern or an opinion
cannot stand up to logic’s scrutiny, it will be or should be rejected. Unfortunately, you cannot always
translate your visual image or what you understand about it, into language. Without Gate 62, you
will find yourself looking for a name to represent your concepts, for facts to support your opinions,
and for an effective means to communicate your suggestions. Mental anxiety for you arises out of
the fear that no one will understand and value your input.

Gate 62 says, “I think.” It is designed to name, concretize, and communicate a visual pattern. It
selects and organizes details as facts in order to better understand and explain complex concepts or
situations. When connected to Gate 17's ability to structure the concept, Gate 62’s supportive details
make these concepts tangible, meaningful and understandable so they can be repeated and tested
over time. Understanding is logic’s gift — and yours. When you address complicated situations with
clear, appropriate and well-organized details, your opinions increase our understanding of the world.
When you wait to be asked to speak, you increase the Collective's potential receptivity to what you
are sharing, and you avoid the embarrassment of compulsively blurting out facts and details that
are unwanted, unnecessary and may potentially obscure people’s understanding. The quality of your
opinion is always dependent on your grasp of the facts, but all facts are not equal. It is helpful to
remember that you can have all the details in hand, but without Gate 17 may not necessarily be able
to put them into their proper structural context for expression in the moment.

SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 217

Logic’s dance partner in the Collective Circuit Group is the Sensing (abstract) Circuit. The Sensing
Circuit is keyed to the abstract experiential process. Through it we encounter and reflect upon life, and
share the emotional and spiritual realm of human experience. This is the human experiential way; a
joyful but sometimes perilous journey through life’s endless progression of opportunities to explore,
collect and share the experiences of being alive. If we can enter each new experience cleanly and
clearly, we feel a deep sense of accomplishment, live life well, and feel at home in the world. In a
greater sense, life will be well lived through us, and our reflections on our experiences will become
valuable lessons for others.

Logic is built around theories and rules for establishing harmony in community, but the Abstract says
that arbitrary restrictions can stifle the experience that is so essential to humanity's evolution. Logic
is motivated by the need to master; the Abstract is motivated by cycles of accomplishment, which
means it is important to complete something so one can move on to the next. Logic cannot manifest
while the Abstract can. What the Abstract manifests, however, is subject to the emotional wave and its
movement from the expectations of desire to the stasis of disappointment and boredom. Both ends of
the wave succeed in driving humanity to progress toward the next new thing.

‘The Understanding Circuit has constant access to Splenic survival awareness, and to Logic with
its process of testing, proving and then sharing patterns that enhance our future. This is a process
commonly associated with the Sciences. The Sensing Circuit, however, is focused on the desire
for experiences (often with sexual overtones) that promote emotional/relational growth and
development. The experience doesn't have to make sense, but it does need to be substantive, and
something that can be shared with another person from beginning to end. The Abstract process is
associated with fields of study such as anthropology or literature. From Logic’s point of view, the
Abstract experiential way is a messy and unnecessary process.

‘The Sensing Circuit does not have the Spleen to provide stability and safety for the Abstract process.
Experience is based precariously on the emotional desire to do something new and exciting with
another person. When things don't change, boredom and restlessness set in. Creating a crisis is
one way to get things moving again. This is what makes Abstract circuitry the most human of all
processes. Reflecting upon experience is the Collective’s most potent force for evolving life on the
planet. Without this force, we would not have evolved into the consciously aware, differentiated and
complex human beings we have become.

‘The Collective's reflections on past experience become the foundations of our history. People with
definition in the Sensing Circuit cannot make sense of life while it is happening, but are genetically
programmed to become storehouses of wisdom. It’s our uniquely human capacity to select, to
remember and to bring forward historical perspectives. We choose what we deem to be of value
from what has been. It is an art to be able to condense and articulate the past in ways that can be
shared in the moment and illuminate the future. Each perspective, each lesson learned, adds a line
to the script from which life’s drama continues to unfold. The retelling of human history greatly
speeds up our learning process because no child has to begin from scratch when it enters the world.

The Channels and Gates of the Sensing Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
218 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF MATURATION: 53 - 42
A Design of Balanced Development
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Maturation links the Root Center to the Sacral Center
through the Gate of Beginnings (53) and the Gate of Growth (42). The
maturation process is at the heart of the (abstract) human experiential way.
This process requires entering into and completing a new cycle or experience,
and then reflecting on it in order to gain the wisdom the cycle offers.

Background: The quality of any channel in the Sensing Circuit is lived cyclically
z in the uninterrupted movement from commitment to completion, from the
ie beginning through the middle to the end of a project, a relationship or a life. The
. abstract experiential process creates the collective history from which humanity
learns. The great gift of experience is that it is collected and stored for following generations, allowing
us to develop intellectually much faster than we do biologically. It is important that we learn from our
experiential history, finding out what works in order to not repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
Each new experience builds upon the last. If a cycle ends prematurely, we will need to repeat it until it is
completed. This process is not goal oriented. It embodies the wisdom that all of life’s experiences are to be
appreciated as part of a journey that never ends. Maturing through experience is one of the keys to being
human. We are all driven and pressured to seek new experiences, as this is how we gain our depth. By
reflecting on our depth, we can translate our experience into information for others.

Personal: Each of your experiences must be brought to a satisfying resolution so that you can turn
around and look back over it before beginning another cycle. Reflection shared with others helps you
to reveal for yourself the valuable lessons learned from the experience. In this way, a new experience
can begin by building on the old. It is important that you begin an experience using your Strategy
and Authority. Ifyou don't, you can become trapped in a cycle that you soon lose interest in or cannot
complete. To properly navigate this territory, it is important to understand expectation. When you
have expectations, you leave yourself open to frustration, disappointment, and an emotional crash.
Simply éeing in an experience for its own sake, without expectation, is healthy for you.

Interpersonal: As the format energy* for the Sensing Circuit, the Channel of Maturation establishes a
cyclic frequency that permeates every gate and channel in the circuit. It influences the way those who
have it view and experience their life, as well as how they interact with and
impact others. The commitment to enter a new experience sets the maturation
process in motion, a process that could take from a few hours to a lifetime.
‘Those with the Channel of Maturation have a deep affinity for history, and are
attuned to all cycles of life: physical, societal, and planetary. When they enter
into an experience through their own Authority, they are equipped with the
energy to begin something, find satisfaction in its development, bring it to a
successful conclusion, and upon reflection share the long term benefits with

others for the greater good of humanity.

GATE 53: DEVELOPMENT - THE GATE OF BEGINNINGS

Gate 53 is the pressure to begin the cyclical process of maturation, and the sequence of development from
birth to death. This is a format energy that applies to all life forms as well as to relationships, ideas, projects,
trends, and even the life cycles of nations and civilizations. You carry the fuel needed to begin something
new. If you give yourself time to correctly decide where to commit your energy, you will initiate the cycle
whose time has come, and you will be able to see it flower and ripen, and leave its seed for the future. Your
role is to provide the impetus to get the cycle moving. Follow your Strategy and Authority in order to
avoid beginning projects or relationships that you are not equipped to or interested in finishing yourself, or
that you are unable to pass on to someone with Gate 42 who can bring what you started to completion. If
your beginnings continually meet resistance, or are stopped before they mature, your disappointment can
cycle into depression. If you commit to beginning something correctly, you are not compelled to complete
it yourself. You will find that you can appropriately discharge the pressure, take what you learned from the
experience, and enjoy sharing that wisdom with others. Without Gate 42, you are not designed to finish
everything you begin, but you can feel frustrated by thinking that you always have to.

Gate 42 is the tenacity to stay with a cycle in order to maximize its inherent potential. The Abstract’s cyclical
process generates growth, and balanced development by using humanity's collected experiences to create a
foundation for future progress. Each cycle you enter into builds on the lessons learned from the last. When a
cycle has run its course, you will determine what is needed to bring it to a conclusion. Before you can begin
anew cycle, the former cycle must be brought to its natural end, or what was left unfinished or incomplete
will have to be revisited in the new one. That is especially true in relationships where you can feel stuck or
held back by unresolved patterns of behavior that can date back as far as your childhood. You are focused on,
what it takes energetically to complete a cycle or process, and weak or insufficiently supported beginnings
will make you nervous and uncomfortable. It is important that what you commit to is correct for you, as it is
very difficult for you to extract yourself from something once you have committed to it, like an unfortunate
marriage for example. By waiting until you are comfortable committing your energy, through Strategy and
Authority, you maximize your own ‘satisfaction potential.’ Without Gate 53 to provide the initiating spark,
you may find that you lack the staying power to complete the process, or feel frustrated trying to start things
that never really get going.

THE CHANNEL OF DISCOVERY: 29 - 46
A Design of Succeeding where Others Fail
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Discovery links the Sacral Center to the G Center through
the Gate of Perseverance (29) and the Gate of the Determination of the Self
(46). In the ’Ching, the 29th gate is known as the “deep within the deep,”
the Sacral’s well of stamina and perseverance that is accessed only through
a “yes” response. The 46th gate connects the vehicle to the direction of the
higher self in order to be in the right place at the right time.

Background: People with the Channel of Discovery need to let go of
all expectations, and become completely immersed in the depth of any
experience because its full meaning is not revealed until the end. Gate 46, the
love of the body, and the love of being in the body, connects them to their vehicle and its trajectory or
direction. If a person begins an experience with a decision made through response, maintains a total
and unwavering commitment to it, and is patient with a process that can take years, the discoveries
made can significantly transform the way the Collective perceives or experiences the world.

Personal: There is no “changing horses in the middle of the stream” for you, and no looking back,
so a clear commitment through Strategy and Authority is vital to the satisfaction you will derive
and the education you will be able to share from your discovery process. You must be able to lose
yourself in the experience because it will not necessarily make sense to you while you are living it. If
you can trust that you are in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, however, you will get to
the end and make your discovery. You will succeed where others have failed. For you it is not about
being in control, but rather surrendering your expectations to the cycles of discovery. This is why it is
so important that you have your life force correctly committed and your Sacral’s stamina supporting
your experience the entire way!

Interpersonal: People with the Channel of Discovery have a built-in availability, and a tendency
to say “yes” to almost any request. Those with unconscious (red) definition are particularly prone to
giving their energy away. If their commitments are the result of a mental decision, they will most
likely fail where others succeed, thus turning potential satisfaction into frustration. Unlike logic,
which theoretically postulates what might happen if a person does this or that, the past is the
only teacher for the experiential learners. It is not until they get to the end of an experience that
they discover, through examination and analysis, what is worth repeating and what is not, which
is what they then share with the Collective. It is only through correctly saying “yes” that they can
persevere through extreme challenges without allowing others to deter them from the course of
their experience, and its potential for discovery.

Gate 29’s potential is a constant affirmation of life. When it answers yes, it commits its energy to
something or someone new, and will persevere through whatever the cycle of discovery brings.
Perseverance is cyclical, however, and what you are committed to one day may no longer be of
interest the next. Each correct commitment you make supports the maturation of your full potential
for discovering who you are in relationship to others and the world. You are always eager to say “yes,”
always ready to commit your energy, so it is best to wait until you are quite clear about what is truly
right for you to invest your energy in. Your Sacral response is mechanical, and you cannot know
where the adventure will take you or what wonders you may find. Gate 29 has a single-minded
energy designed to move you through even the most difficult and challenging circumstances, but
only if it is fully aligned with your decision. Your only insurance is to let go of your expectations, and
rely on your Strategy and Authority to guide you to the correct experiences. Without the 46th gate,
you are ready to work but do not know what you are working towards.

The 46th gate is focused on the quality of life we experience in a physical body. It expresses the love
of the body, and the sensual honoring of it as a temple in which we are always in the right place at the
right time. You are one who lives the good fortune and discovery of serendipity. Whether you succeed
or fail is dependent on the determination of your higher self. This is an abstract process of surrender
to a cycle of experience that can fulfill your potential, or bring chaos. The lessons you learn and the
wisdom you share with others is derived from your determination, dedication to and absorption in the
experience as you are living it. The experience of the nature of your self in interaction with others is a
deeply spiritual process, and can only be evaluated when the cycle is complete. If you cannot commit
yourself to the cyclical nature of life, your body will begin to fail under the stress of constant crisis.
Without the 29th gate, you may recognize the right timing, but not have the energy to begin the
process or the perseverance to complete it.

THE CHANNEL OF THE PRODIGAL: 13 - 33
A Design of a Witness
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of the Prodigal links the G Center to the Throat Center
through the Gate of the Listener (Gate 13) and the Gate of Privacy (Gate
33). This channel is one of reflection and remembrance. Gate 13 listens and
stores information and secrets, harvesting memories from which lessons may
be learned. Gate 33 retreats to reflect on its experiences, patiently waiting
for what is beneath the surface to reveal itself in the form of a deeper truth.

Background: Peculiar to human beings is their desire to explore all there is
in life, and their drive to experience it first-hand. Channel 13-33 brings the
experiential cyclical process of maturation to an end, adding the capacity
to see and reflect on all sides of an experience afterwards before sharing it. It’s what gives us our
incredible advantage as an evolving, self-aware species. This is the Prodigal, the witness, experiencing
and then gathering memories so they can be passed on in some form of personal biography or
collective history lesson. Such remembering brings continuity and stability to the evolution of
civilization from one generation to the next.

Personal: As a natural listener and record keeper, you collect life stories, secrets and memorabilia.
You then retreat to ponder and organize what you have gathered in preparation for sharing your
reflections in the lessons you have gleaned from them. Your challenge is timing. You don’t want
to reveal your secrets before their time, or remain so private no one will ever hear them. You are
willing to break with the patterns of family and society so as to choose experiences that are correct
for you to learn from. Most people enter experiences with a specific expectation but at the end of
the cycle discover that the results did not match those expectations. They lose patience and miss
the magic of completion with its precious lessons. You share with all of us, from your experience,
that it is far more fulfilling to simply witness the sequence of unfolding events than to suffer the
frustration and disappointment of unmet expectations. The wisdom gained over time from this
form of patient reflection reveals some of the greatest truths in our collective history. One of the
most valuable lessons you bear witness to, and share with us, is how to comfortably surrender to
our own experiential process as a passenger consciousness.

Interpersonal: The Collective Abstract says, “I remember my experience or inexperience.” Over a
lifetime, those with the Channel of the Prodigal accumulate gems of wisdom that can be organized
as the lessons of a personal or collective history. This organization requires patience. They might
enjoy photography, scrapbooking, or listening to people recollect their life’s stories. They might
be a politician, a comedian or our confidante. Those with Channel 13-33 look to and learn from
the past so they are not good at predicting the future in order meet the challenges of the present.
‘They are the first ones, however, to tell us that life does make sense in the end.

With its gift for hearing, seeing and storing secrets, Gate 13 provides continuity between the past
and the future in its role as the listener. You are perceived as a confidante and a keeper of secrets.
People naturally share their experiences with you because you genuinely enjoy hearing their stories,
their adventures, victories and challenges. They sense that you are quite comfortable simply holding
inside you what has been shared. Gate 13 is not pressured by the Throat Center to speak. You will
recognize the right moment to share what is most valuable from your remembering because it will
be drawn from you by people who are able to properly select, reflect upon and organize it for sharing
with the broader community, such as people with Gate 33. In this way, you insure that the important
lessons, which can only be learned through experience, are held and cherished until the time is right
for them to contribute to humanity’s understanding of itself. Historical continuity informs our
future as a species. Without Gate 33, your secrets may never be shared.

Gate 33 marks the end of a cycle, and built into all endings is a moment of silence for considering
every aspect of the experience. This is where your need to be alone comes from. Retreat for you arises
in that moment of uncertainty between the completed experience and a new one, a pause that allows
you to reflect on what to take forward while you renew your strength. It is in the quiet moments
of contemplation that the most valuable lessons, stored in the depths of Collective memory (Gate
13), will come to the surface. In Gate 33 your need for privacy is joined by the Collective's voice
of “I remember.” It is also your nature to share the lessons of experience and reveal its truths. The
experience can be one of your own, or another's, or even that of a group of people; the process is the
same. When the time is ripe, you will be asked to share your wisdom which then becomes part of
the greater community and humanity’s evolving consciousness. Like the Prodigal, you mature over
your lifetime, and your realm of influence expands as you move through each cycle of experience.
Without Gate 13 you may not have a sense of the right timing for sharing your lessons.

THE CHANNEL OF RECOGNITION: 41 - 30
A Design of Focused Energy (Feelings)
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Recognition links the Root Center to the Solar Plexus Center
through the Gate of Contraction (41) and the Gate of Feelings (30). The Root
pressure (fuel) of Gate 41 starts with a feeling of restlessness, and energizes
the imagination to fantasize about countless scenarios for what “could be.”
‘When connected to Gate 30, the emotions of the Solar Plexus heat up the
fuel, resulting in an intense need to seek out or begin moving in the direction
of a new experience.

Background: Genetically speaking, the 41st hexagram is the initiating
codon in our DNA. When the sun moves into Gate 41 in January of each
year, we begin a new solar cycle (a new year) and initiate a physiological process in humanity that
keeps us evolving together. All of the possibilities of human experience are stored within this gate,
and the entire experiential process is driven by its Root-fueled desire for new experiences and the
expectation of being satiated in the end. This hunger can only be satisfied temporarily. The Abstract
(Sensing) process is focused on accomplishment, on the completion of a cycle, and is driven by a
desire or expectation that ‘doing’ something will overcome boredom. This is the beginning of the
human experiential way. Our cultural evolution, the progression from the ignorance and innocence of
inexperience to the wisdom of lessons learned from experience, culminate in Channel 36-35.

Personal: You are a person with great imagination and an endless yearning to take in life and feel
it deeply. Your dreams, fantasies or wishes, sometimes accompanied by sexual overtones, create
expectations that, when in the hands of fate (Gate 30), may or may not be fulfilled. Over time
you have learned that desire can bring great joy or excitement as well as pain, and the fulfillment
of any desire does not last long. Your restlessness for new experience is balanced by developing
the patience and self control needed to follow your emotional Authority and take sufficient time
through your wave to make clear decisions. The secret for you is to simply enjoy your dreams and
each experience in and of itself, without giving in to the pressure of expectation. In this way your
experiences will be more fulfilling, your reflections more poignant, and your sharing more likely
to stir the feelings of others.

Interpersonal: In the Channel of Recognition, the pressure to move is connected to an intense
feeling or emotion, providing the momentum to leap from inexperience into experience at a
moment's notice. Waiting through their emotional wave gives those with this channel the essential
time needed for clarity to emerge before deciding which of their desires is correct to jump into. This
pressure may launch some pretty wild rides, generally involving others, but can also stimulate deep
reflection for all participants after the adventure is complete. Each new experience allows them to
perceive or connect to a nuance of emotion they can then describe.

GATE 41: DECREASE - THE GATE OF CONTRACTION
~The limitation of resources which maximizes development of potential —
Center: Root Quarter: Mutation ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Unexpected — JC of Fantasy - LAC of the Alpha

Gate 41 initiates the uniquely human experiential way as a hunger to experience emotion. It begins
with the desire to interact with others through feelings. When this initiating Root pressure of
desire builds in you, it may manifest as a vague expectation, a sexual fantasy or a restless need to
experience something new with someone. You are not sure what this new experience is or when
it will happen or with whom. Gate 41 drives you toward satisfying your desire and fulfilling your
destiny, both of which rest in the hands of the fates (Gate 30.) You bring balance to this unfocused
and often confusing restlessness by writing or daydreaming about what it might be like to fulfill
your wildest desires, or by vicariously experiencing them through literature and movies. Gate 41
holds the potential for all human experiences, but releases or initiates only one at a time. This is its
limitation, and yours. Each new experience that you enter into through your Strategy and Authority
holds a promise that a new feeling awaits your discovery. By letting go of your expectations, you can
move freely through each encounter and avoid becoming pessimistic about future ones. Without
Gate 30 there is a feeling of wanting something, but not knowing what it is that you want.

GATE 30: THE CLINGING FIRE - THE GATE OF FEELINGS
— Freedom recognized as an illusion and limitation accepted as a fate —
Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Contagion — JC of Fates — LAC of Industry

The Gate of the Fates teaches us that life is not what we expect it to be — it is what we allow it
to be. Your experiences are conceived from a desire that then meets life on the highs and lows of
your emotional wave. This desire can feel like an obsessive hunger that weaves the yearnings of
different lives together, influencing your every interaction until it is satisfied or fulfilled. The only
control you have is over the clarity with which you enter into each experience, not over the outcome.
Because desire can only be temporarily assuaged, life without clarity becomes a wild emotional
ride. Over time, you see that the freedom to fulfill your wildest dreams is merely an illusion, and
unreciprocated desire should not be taken personally. Balance in your life comes through surrender,
through accepting what is. In doing so, you need not fear the fates or feel pressured to chase after
the fantasies of Gate 41. By accepting your limitation, or place in the larger pattern of life, your
reflections on feeling and desiring deeply while experiencing your humanness become a gift to be
shared with others.

THE CHANNEL OF TRANSITORINESS: 36 - 35
A Design of a “Jack of all Trades”
Circuit: Sensing (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Manifested

‘The Channel of Transitoriness links the Solar Plexus Center to the Throat
Center through the Gate of Crisis (36) and the Gate of Change (35). This is
an emotional Manifesting channel that defies Logic’s caution and restrictive
patterns. It will try anything and everything, whether of intrinsic value or
not, to get things moving in the direction of a new experience.

Background: As the creative channel for the Sensing Circuit, Channel 36-
35 has a talent for seeking adventures and involving others in them. It finds
expression through Gate 35’s need to manifest change as in “been there,
done that, what’s new?” The emotionally-charged 36th gate perceives its
inexperience as inadequacy, and so draws those with the Channel of Transitoriness into seeking
experience, occasionally by engendering a crisis just to get things moving. Through this restless
desire to explore the depth and consequence of our capacity to feel (emotion), our species matures
and evolves and our gene pool expands, ultimately resulting in progress for the Collective. This is
learning through experience for the sake of future generations.

Personal: You are driven to seek experiences which promise something new and better in life.
Your journey is an emotional one and you gather wisdom experientially. Pushed along by the ever-
changing perspectives of your unaware Solar Plexus wave, you can become volatile or feel let down if
a new experience fails to meet your expectations. The secret is to embrace and accept your emotional
swings, to give yourself time to make emotionally-clear decisions, and to surrender to fully living
each correct experience for its own sake. Over time and with maturity, experience will culminate
as emotional depth within your personal truth, the heart of which is accepting life for what it is. If
you find yourself nervous or uneasy about committing to a venture, take advantage of waiting out
your wave. Your great accomplishment in life is that you will have tasted, touched and felt many
things from which you gleaned wisdom of great value, wisdom that you make available to others in
the form of advice. You inspire people to join your ventures with tales of your exploits, and sense of
fulfillment in the richness of a life well lived. As you learn that feelings are transitory, your advice to
others will be to “seize the moment,” and partake of each promising new experience that is correct,
rather than live with a sense that nothing in life ever amounts to anything.

Interpersonal: For those with the Channel of Transitoriness, interaction with others means sharing
the experience completely with them. Their need for new experience, and inherent sense that nothing
lasts, often makes it difficult for them to maintain intimate relationships. Their partner(s) pay a price
if they find themselves dragged along on adventures that are not right for them. Doing anything for
the first time isn’t easy, outcomes are unpredictable, and most people are not equipped to handle the
resulting crises. Deeply emotional experiences often have a sexual dimension, but because relating
here is focused on the feelings provoked by the experience rather than on the other person, both
parties can be left with disappointment when the experience is over. When two people connect
electromagnetically through this channel, one with Gate 35 and one with Gate 36, the balance and
stability of the relationship will be constantly subjected to the high to low emotional wave.

~The rule of cycles in which decline is a natural but not enduring stage —

Gate 36 is the place where your fears of vulnerability and inexperience (emotional and sexual) are
resolved or transformed into experience; where you create and meet the challenges of change and
growth through emotional crises. As you gain emotional clarity over time, you learn how to handle
emotional crises created by others, and you create less of them yourself. Gate 36 restrains the strong
hope-to-pain wave that drives human experience toward change. Its energy is aimed directly at the
‘Throat Center which means that the full range and depth of your emotions are being readied for
manifestation. All that is needed is someone or something to trigger their release. Without Gate
35 to provide a proper outlet or give a focused direction to this energy, it can be experienced as a
personal crisis. You learn over time to remain steady by patiently adapting to constantly changing
feelings. These feelings can prove to be wonderfully stimulating and natural for you to express, or
overwhelming to you and uncomfortable for others. Either way, let them unfold as this is how
you reach for your emotional depth in order to access your own truth. Without Gate 35, feeling
inadequate and unable to fulfill your own expectations makes you nervous.

Gate 35 is driven by a restless curiosity, and high expectations, to explore new horizons for the
sheer exhilaration of doing it, but not alone. Gate 35’s voice says, “I feel,” and what it usually feels
is a desire for change. Yours is the voice of impersonal, relational experience. You are prodded along
not by awareness, but by a hunger for depth of feeling that is conditioned by the emotional wave.
Like hunger, desire and curiosity can only be temporarily ameliorated. You are focused on collecting
experiences to learn from them, rather than on repeating experiences to master them. Mastery for
you is expressed as wisdom and manifests as advice. Your memories may provide more satisfaction
than the experience itself. Your taste for new experience, and the need to see what or who is on the
other side of the mountain, can keep you healthy and alert. When correctly entering into experience
for its own sake, and remaining an objective observer, your clear sharing carries the potential to
transform humanity. Experience seekers don’t often take time to consider the repercussions of their
actions, and without Gate 36, you are prone to seeking an emotional rush in the hope of escaping
the pain of boredom when there is no new experience to dive into.

THE CHANNEL OF ABSTRACTION: 64 - 47
A Design of Mental Activity mixed with Clarity
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Abstraction links the Head Center to the Ajna Center
through the Gate of Confusion (64) and the Gate of Realization (47). Those
with definition in Channel 64-47 are always under pressure to sift through
a kaleidoscope of mental images from every experience, even their dreams.
‘They are trying to make sense out of the past and gain perspective. They seek
a story, or realization to share, either about their life or someone else’s, in this
lifetime or another.

Background: The Channel of Abstraction is an experiential mental force
that dabbles in all kinds of possibilities, regardless of rules, until something
mysteriously emerges and makes sense. This is a mind busy with the consequences of being alive.
Merging the conceptualization of the neocortex (Ajna Center) with the deep gray matter of the brain
(Head Center), it gifts us with the true potential of self-reflected consciousness. To be at peace with
themselves however, those with this channel must remember that the mind can never be an internal
authority for their own life, and it will never be 100 percent sure of anything.

Personal: You have a very active, experiential mind that never stops playing with possibilities, and you
probably wonder if it will ever stop being busy. You can experience considerable mental confusion as
a result of the constant swirl of images always moving through it, feeling at times a bit like a drunk
monkey stung by a scorpion. This confusion can mark the beginning of a new and inspiring journey
for you, as you discover what really does make sense. If you remain patient with your discovery
process, the gaps and spaces between the dots will at some point connect and a picture will appear;
a new, unique sequence will be created or revealed. Your reward for being patient, for waiting for
clarity to emerge over time, is the uncovering of an inspiring tale to tell, or a new perspective to
share with others. You are utterly unequipped with this mental definition, however, to solve your
own problems, or make sense of your own life.

Interpersonal: In order to relieve the pressure to make sense of life, those with the Channel of
Abstraction have to find a way to share their minds with the outside world. Their casual, story-
telling minds, while a gift for historians, should never be relied upon for the facts. This is the part
of our genius that finds either inspiration or confusion in our intellectual drive to break experiences
down, and look at them over and over again from every possible angle, even if most have no value. It
is incredible though to hear the active, experiential mind reach a moment of clarity, whatever path
it has taken to get there, and share that “Aha!” with the Collective.

Accepting confusion, the state before order is established, is part of Gate 64's process of attempting
to make sense of a constant flow of data that continually recycles through the mind. Gate 64 is the
pressure behind that flow, not the gate that resolves the confusion. Your mind is filled with a string
of disconnected memories and images from your past that need filtering and sorting until you can
see or make sense of what really happened. In order to enjoy your mental state of confusion and not
become overwhelmed by it, let the clips of your past experiences simply stream through your mind
until the message of the movie becomes clear to you. When it does, share it with others. If you put
pressure on your mind to figure the data out with a specific methodology, you may increase both
your level of confusion and anxiety. It takes great inner strength to let the confusion process resolve
in its own way and time, thus leaving your peace of mind intact. It may also be tempting to react in
some way once the clarity arrives, but these “aha's” are for sharing, not acting upon. Without Gate
47 you may be tempted to resolve the confusion prematurely.

If Gate 64 is the one who remembers the disorganized collection of film clips that passes through its
life, then Gate 47 is the editor who attempts to assemble them all into a meaningful slice of human
experience. You will not see the full picture immediately as you tentatively start to sort through the
collection of images, and it may not be apparent to you at first which clip holds the key to your
eventual mental realization. As new details emerge, you may vacillate between perceiving the event
this way or that way through a mix of recognitions that direct you toward different interpretations.
At first you may feel that rather than the process becoming easier, it is becoming more complicated
for you to reassemble the mental sequences in a way that makes sense. If you can step back and trust,
however, you will eventually cycle through to that “aha” moment. The secret is to avoid the pressure
to act on every conclusion that comes to you, and simply enjoy the array of possibilities that move
through your active mind, until one stands out. You are then ready, when asked and it is correct for
you, to share your recognitions with others. Without Gate 64 you may put pressure on yourself, and
forget to wait for the revelation that will truly bring the mental activity to a temporary halt.

THE CHANNEL OF CURIOSITY: 11 - 56
A Design of the Searcher
Circuit: Sensing Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Curiosity links the Ajna Center to the Throat Center

. through the Gate of Ideas (Gate 11) and the Gate of Stimulation (Gate

56). Seekers never stop searching, no matter what or how much they find.

‘Their curiosity compels them to continually seek stimulation, to explore new

ideas and ways of seeing things. This curiosity is not about setting out to find

something specific but rather, “Look at what I have discovered. This is what
I believe to be true about it.”

Background: The Collective's social obligation is to share,and the Channel of
Curiosity provides us with people specially equipped to do so: the storyteller
and the casual historian. They are our truth seekers, and they teach from experience. Their stories
give us an opportunity to evaluate whether we want the new idea or belief to inform or transform
our life, or not. Unlike the voice of Logic which is focused on data and facts, the transformative
Abstract voice takes all of the bits and pieces of information, and elaborates on them by filling in the
gaps. In this way, information is brought to life as a story that has the power to influence people by
stimulating their imagination and emotions. The 56th gate is more fascinated with seeking than with
finding. It is continually open to stimulation and experience for its own sake, but is not motivated
to create those experiences itself.

Personal: Your creativity and style of presentation can be magical, as you weave together ideas and
stories from your philosophical reflections on what it means to be a human being experiencing life.
You have an enviable gift for taking a sequence of ideas, and fashioning a story out of them that can
teach or entertain an audience. Even if these stories are somewhat exaggerated or contain some half
truths, like your child telling you about their day at school, you still draw others in and stimulate
them. Your capacity to believe in something makes it true for you, and you are less interested in facts
than you are in how your stories illustrate and teach. Your stories are more like parables for life. Even
though they flow from your personal experiences and discoveries, however, they are not as useful a
guide for you as they are for others. They are stories to be shared, collected and stored for reflection
and interpretation by present and future generations. This is a process unique to human beings.

Interpersonal: We no longer rely on the ballads of bards and minstrels to keep us informed
about world events, yet we still admire the storytellers who can weave a good yarn and generate
stimulating social commentary. The receptivity of an audience to the magic of the story, however,
is determined by the proper timing of the story’s delivery. When these skillful storytellers and
teachers follow their Strategy and Authority, they will enjoy sharing their extraordinary gifts
while effectively informing, entertaining and stimulating the rest of us.

Ideas are concepts designed to express what has been sensed. In Gate 11, possibilities are
conceptualized into ideas. These ideas are not prescriptions for action, however, as ideas come and
go. At this point in the abstract process, you are given a quiet moment for assessment to sort out
what has been remembered over the ups and downs of the experiential process. You are prone
to remembering what you really liked about what you saw, while leaving the rest out. This is
how ideas become ideals, then beliefs and finally belief systems over time. You seek the ideas of
others to stimulate your own reflections, and you enjoy stimulating others with your ideas, but not
indiscriminately. Ideas reach the Throat Center as verbal expressions, not as manifestations of action,
and they are designed simply to be reflected upon. Trying to solve your life’s dilemmas with your
own ideas will lead to frustration, further crises and confusion. You can take great delight, however,
in savoring the stimulating details of past moments for their own sake. Without Gate 56 you are
under pressure to tell your stories, and may do so impulsively without waiting for the right riming.

Gate 56 is where ideas are gathered together, and where visual memory is recollected and verbally
recounted. This is the gate of the casual historian. It is the voice of the storyteller and philosopher
that says, “I believe.” An idea is not a solution, or a call to action, but rather a journey over time
designed to stimulate the formation of our ideals and beliefs. Your mind translates human experience
into language. Once an idea is expressed verbally, the process is complete. Your feelings influence
which new ideas and experiences you seek to explore, and your recollections or stories about them
are subjective and selective. What you teach us about life will include some facts, but the unique
lessons will come from your interpretation of the experience tinged with emotional overtones. Your
stories add colorful threads to the expanding tapestry of humanity's progress. Without Gate 11 you
are often searching for new sources of stimulation and new ideas for stories to tell.

TRIBAL CIRCUIT GROUP

When we enter the Tribal realm, we meet interdependence as support, as well as the not-self in
the form of co-dependence. Interdependence is the mutuality and reciprocity upon which early
societies were structured and maintained. The job of the Tribe is to deal with the consequences of
being alive by devising ways for people to live together that increase productivity, and maximize our

SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 233

ability to protect ourselves. The Tribe connects us to life and each other through the senses, through
bloodlines (ancestry), and through loyalty to the blood bargain. The Tribal heart is a communal
heart, where everybody else’s business is everybody else’s business. This is in part what gives the
Tribe its reputation for being ‘sticky’ and possessive. For the Tribe, support is about having. The
Tribe is sensitive to people’s basic need for food, shelter, clothing, and a structure to hold everything
together. When these are provided, there is peace in the kingdom. When they are lacking, the Tribe
is equipped to revolt in order to establish equilibrium between those who have more than they need,
and those who do not have enough. Revolution is a form of Tribal justice.

Two circuits make up the Tribal Circuit Group: one major, the Ego Circuit, and one minor, the
Defense Circuit. The Ego Circuit has a double focus. Its initial focus is on the business of the
material world, such as family, or the creation and distribution of monetary resources. Its second
focus balances humanity’s need to survive on the material plane with our deep need for God (spirit).
‘The Ego Circuit creates the two forces of continuing support that keep people in the Tribe. The
Defense circuit is concerned with generating, caring for, nurturing and preserving human life (the
Tribe), and the laws and values of Tribal relationships.

In our exploration of the BodyGraph as a circuit board, the core Integration Channel is resolutely
separate, the epitome of self-sufficiency. The Individual Circuit Group empowers the quality of
uniqueness in humanity that paves the way for mutation, and the Collective Circuit Group is staunchly
communal, socially interactive and mutually respectful in its orientation. The Tribe’s strong communal
structure is founded on loyalty to a hierarchical chain of command. The Tribal Circuit builds a wall
around itself, and would label all of the other circuits outsiders, while the Defense Circuit pulls even
the most strident outsider into the bonds of communal living with its penetrating intimacy, and its
promise to nurture and provide resources.

‘The Spleen’s instinctual survival awareness relays messages through the senses, particularly smell,
touch and taste. This awareness compliments and focuses the Tribe’s extraordinary capacity for
personal loyalty and sexual intimacy. It is also what guides the ways communal expectations and
support are expressed. For example, the famous family recipe that is handed down as a form of
family identity, the handshake or kiss that seals a deal, and the blood bond between best friends.

‘The Tribe’s most distinguishing characteristic is the bargain, or making deals that guarantee
support. “I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine. Ill clean the house and feed the children if
you go out and work to make money for the family.” The bargain, which permeates all channels
in Tribal circuitry, imposes or pre-supposes loyalty to a larger, hierarchical system of rulership and
values. “I will see that you are protected from invaders if you pay me homage and taxes.” Tribal
bargaining ensured our species’ survival. Throughout history, the Tribe has been the bedrock that
held us together as a family unit or a nation. It has determined for us how to raise our children,
choose a vocation, make the laws and police our streets, and worship our gods. Without the Tribe,
we would not have been able to look after ourselves within a society. It gave each of us a place in
its support net, and as long as we stayed in our place and made our contribution, it kept us safe.

Preservation (taking care of what we have produced). The visual image of a cradle that the Defense
Circuit forms in the BodyGraph is an apt metaphor for its generative and nurturing role in ensuring
humanity’s future through the creation and preservation of life on the planet. The Defense Circuit’s
genetic program, described as the origin of the theory of the selfish gene, promotes the continuation of
our species. It often does so, however, at the expense of our personal life. Nothing drives humanity like
the Channel of Intimacy’s (59-6) genetic imperative to make more. The emotional wave that in part
powers this imperative is not yet aware, and in its blindness can leave chaos in its wake.

Children are one by-product of this unstable emotional mechanism for perpetuating life on the planet.
The Channel of Preservation (27-50) grounds the Tribe's survival in Splenic awareness, with the
sobering reminder that we are responsible for nurturing and preserving that which the emotional/
experiential Channel of Intimacy has created or generated. In this way, offspring will reach adulthood
and can in turn produce more, keeping the gene pool viable so that our bio-form can keep going. This
is the Tribe’s major contribution to evolving consciousness; no other circuit or circuit group carries this
genetic imperative or is equipped to nurture what it creates like the Tribe.

The Channels and Gates of the Defense Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
236 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF MATING: 59 - 6
A Design Focused on Reproduction,
Circuit: Defense (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Mating links the Sacral Center to the Solar Plexus Center
through the Gate of Sexuality (59) and the Gate of Friction (6). Channel
fi 59-6, the core of humanity’s creative essence, is rooted in a powerful
quantum of Sacral and emotional energy called ‘intimacy.’ The sexuality of
Gate 59, and the pleasure/pain emotional wave of Gate 6, bring people into
relationships that are deeply personal, penetrating and potentially fertile.

Background: A defined Solar Plexus is always one’s Authority, and the
emotional wave requires that one wait to find clarity over time. If the
Channel of Mating is conditioned by not-self spontaneity and ignores
its Sacral response, it can create confusion and greatly complicate social interactions. There can
also be long-term repercussions such as an unwanted child or a failed business venture. The true
intimacy potential in this Tribal channel requires patience and nurturing over time. For that
reason it is healthiest to cultivate a friendship with business partners or lovers first, before diving
into the depths of an intimate union with them.

Personal: Yours is the urge to merge, and when guided by response over time this can be healthy
and deeply satisfying on many levels. Your own availability to intimacy allows you to quickly and
easily penetrate the auras of others, facilitating a coziness that paves the way for fertility in any
creative endeavor. This is your natural state, and a true asset for establishing relationships of any
kind. You can also be misunderstood, however, and your intensity misinterpreted by others who
may feel you are flirting or “coming on” to them when you don’t mean to. Your emotional wave,
through Gate 6, determines the actual timing of any intimate emotional release by either drawing
you closer or pushing you away. Waiting out your wave's cycle allows you to discern or discover
over time if something has been conceived between the two of you — and if it hasn’t, the wave may
draw you together again.

Interpersonal: Although designed to experience a potent emotional wave, those with the Channel
of Mating can actually appear quite stable emotionally. Their wave is activated or brought to the
point of response by the proximity or touch of another person. A well-timed hug, or hand on the
shoulder, at just the right point on their wave helps them release pent up emotions that cannot
be expressed through words. This is a form of intimacy that can be expressed through tears, a
heart-felt sigh or by deeply relaxing into someone’s understanding embrace. Doing so maintains
a healthy sense of emotional balance between stronger (sexual) emotional releases. Channel 59-6
is best experienced as an electromagnetic connection between two people, when each partner has
one of the gates.
SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 237

GATE 59: DISPERSION - THE GATE OF SEXUALITY
~The ability to break down barriers to achieve union —
Center: Sacral Quarter: Duality ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of the Sleeping Phoenix ~ JC of Strategy - LAC of Spirit

Gate 59 generates our genetic strategies for sexual bonding and creating new life. Also known
as the “aura breaker,” it defines the ways we penetrate or break through barriers to intimacy in
order to create offspring, or enter into a creative venture with others. The lines of Gate 59 (listed
below) describe the ways humanity approaches bonding. They are genetic strategies, and each role
is singularly focused on selecting the best partner for producing the most viable offspring. The 4th
line, requires you to become friends first, for example, and one-night stands, which are correct for
the 6th line, would not be an option for you. The only real choice you have in this matter is to enter
into each intimate relationship through your Authority. Tribal intimacy is warm and deeply felt; it’s
an intimacy beyond words intensified by your sensitivity to the other through touch, taste and smell.
Unless you pay attention to your Authority and understand the genetic strategies (roles) of Gate 59,
as well as the part that Gate 6’s emotional wave plays, intimacy can bring anything from confusion
and conflict to unproductive unions. You may find yourself automatically looking to someone with
Gate 6 to guide the timing of your interactions.

GATE 6: CONFLICT - THE GATE OF FRICTION
~The fundamental design component of progress. The law that growth cannot exist without friction —
Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Duality ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Eden — JC of Conflict — LAC of the Plane

Gate 6 in the Solar Plexus Center generates all three modes of emotional awareness: feelings, moods
and sensitivity. This is a powerful motorized combination on a wave that is designed to create friction.
This friction produces the heat essential for growth and fertility, and is aimed at Gate 59. The
friction you create when you step into another person's aura is a mechanic. If (or when) the conflict
is resolved, or resonance is reached, there is then an opening and intimacy can proceed. Until there
is such an opening, you must wait, as readiness and fertility are both subject to the emotional wave.
Gate 6 is a kind of diaphragm that is either opens up to intimacy or closes. It is the gate of your pH,
and establishes and maintains the boundary between what is outside and what is inside your body.
In this way it determines who to be intimate with, when, and the bonding role you will play. Each
time you feel drawn toward intimacy, let your Strategy and Authority be your guides. Each gate in
the Solar Plexus carries a fear. The fear associated with the 6th gate is the fear of intimacy, which is
why Gate 6 looks to Gate 59 with its ability to break down the barriers to intimacy.

THE CHANNEL OF PRESERVATION: 27 - 50
A Design of Custodianship
Circuit: Defense Channel Type: Generated

The Channel of Preservation links the Sacral Center to the Splenic Center
through the Gate of Caring (27) and the Gate of Values (50). The quality and
fi substance of all Tribal activities are enhanced through the care and nurturing
of Gate 27 with its altruistic concern for others. The traditional values and
laws of the Tribe that are needed to maintain order, and to enrich, guide and
guard life, originate with Gate 50. Channel 27-50 creates the many levels of
custodianship that are needed to care for, protect and preserve the Tribe and
its creative ventures.

Background: The Sacral energies of Channel 59-6, subject to the warm,
emotional intimacy of the Solar Plexus wave, are focused on creation and procreation. Once
the offspring are born, the Sacral’s immediate response to their vulnerability arouses the strong
and spontaneous survival instincts of the Spleen with its cool realization that we must care for
what we have created. In this way, the warm experiential side of the BodyGraph is balanced by
existential awareness, and the need to guard or accept responsibility for those who cannot take care
of themselves. This level of support is necessary if the Tribe, and what it stands for, is to endure.

Personal: You are someone whose aura automatically elicits trust from others, and people naturally
look to you for support and nurturing. Support through this channel can take many forms, from
establishing and defending the values and laws of the land and being a conscience for the Tribe,
to attending to the upbringing of youngsters or caring for the sick and elderly. You are capable
of assuming a lot of responsibility, and are susceptible to taking on too much. Although you are
a natural nurturer, the only way that you will know if you are taking on the correct responsibility
is through your Strategy and Authority. With a wisdom rooted in ancient awareness informing
your altruism and compassion, you innately understand that nurture begins with the correct care of
yourself first. Only the strong and healthy can nurture and guide others toward survival, improved
health or success. This is called ‘enlightened selfishness,’ and though it may be perceived as self-
indulgence, it is quite different. If someone wants your care, they must ask for it. It is only through
your response that you can know if your energy is available, and if it is correct for you to give it.

Interpersonal: Channel 27-50 has two strong defense mechanisms. Gate 50 instinctually pays close
attention to the continuity of the Tribe. It creates, defends or challenges the fundamental values and
laws governing communal relationships which are responsible for maintaining and protecting the
well-being of all who live in a supportive, hierarchical community. Through Gate 27, our children
are nurtured, educated, healed of conditioning, and taught the value of communal support so that
they can survive long enough to create and nurture the next generation. Nurturing isn't limited to
supporting children; the needs of our elders must also be addressed, and their wisdom harvested
and chronicled. Everything in the world needs nurture and care, including the preservation of the
infrastructure of our communities.

GATE 27: NOURISHMENT - THE GATE OF CARING
~The enhancement of the quality and the substance of all activities through caring —
Center: Sacral Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of the Unexpected — JC of Caring - LAC of Alignment

‘The energy of the 27th gate is focused on maintaining and enhancing the quality of life through
the power to care for the weak, the sick and the young. There is tremendous potential for altruism
present in this gate, which we see exemplified in the life of Mother Teresa. Your role is to nourish and
nurture through the power of compassion; you care. The polarity is that you must also be nourished
and nurtured yourself. You must care for yourself first in order to have the energy and resources to
care for others, and then let your Authority guide you to where and when you commit your energy.
Nourishment or nurturing given without awareness is a waste of precious resources. Each line of
this gate represents a way to connect to and care for the Tribe according to different levels of need.
Without Gate 50, you may lack the instinct and values to set healthy boundaries around your
natural impulse to care for others, and easily end up sacrificing yourself or your own well-being.

Center: Spleen Quarter: Duality Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Laws — JC of Values — LAC of Wishes

Each act of intimacy that results in a birth demands that the offspring of the union be nurtured into
adulthood. Gate 50's mystical name is the Guardian. As the Tribal lawmaker, it establishes what is
right or wrong. This is how and where the rules for caring become the source of moral conditioning
for our children. At the core of the Tribe’s defenses lies the Spleen’s fear-driven mandate to maintain
its own viability by protecting and guiding its young. You are one who is here to guard the values and
integrity of Tribal law, and the structures that uphold the well-being of the community. Based on
the specific line (see below), your task is to be cognizant of which values or laws or rules safeguard
how the Tribe cares for its own. Your instinctual awareness scrutinizes which are corrupt or unjust,
unnecessary or self-serving, or need to be challenged and changed. This is your way of caring for and
nurturing every aspect of life within the Tribe. Without Gate 27 you may try to physically take care
of others when it is not correct for you to do so, thus fulfilling your fear of taking on responsibility
that you aren't equipped to handle.

IRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE 241

The Ego Circuit protectively surrounds the Defense Circuit. Understanding the material and
communal forces of support with which the Ego Circuit sustains the fertile and nurturing
processes of the Defense Circuit, gives us a clearer sense of the nature and scope of the Tribe’s
contribution to our evolution.

On its own, the Ego Circuit has no defined Sacral or life-generating capacity, nor does it have any
connection to mental awareness (Ajna Center). The Ego Circuit’s hub is the Heart or Ego Center.
‘The central focus of this circuit’s five channels is the Ego’s willpower, namely the will to go out
into the world and provide for its own in exchange for deserved rest.

Through the Ego Circuit, we can follow the development of two philosophically divergent points
of view that begin in the Root and meet in the Tribal heart (Ego Center). Each view defines one
of two forces of Tribal support. We experience the spiritual dimension of communal life, with the
core unit of the Tribe the inter-generational family that is traditionally a hierarchical blood-bond
relationship, as well as the ambition and materialism of the entrepreneur. It is in this circuit that
the mysteries of the mystical are cultivated alongside the essentially material and mundane. The
Ego Circuit is also where we find the pragmatism of capitalism, and the ideals of socialism and
communalism.

Together, these two views point to an underlying truth waiting to be discovered in the Ego
Circuit — spirit is hidden in the mundane. Living fully as our authentic selves, in each moment of
our mundane lives, becomes a beautiful process that quietly reveals our connection to spirit, and
the totality of all that is.

The Channels and Gates of the Ego Circuit are discussed on the following pages.
242 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

THE CHANNEL OF TRANSFORMATION: 54 - 32
A Design of Being Driven
Circuit: Ego Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Transformation links the Root Center to the Splenic Center
through the Gate of Drive (54) and the Gate of Continuity (32). Channel
54-32 represents ambition fueled by consistent effort, and motivated by the
desire to be recognized in order to better one’s position in life. The potential
awareness of what can and cannot be transformed, sometimes distorted by a
fear of failure, is driven by the fuel for social interactions that can move one
up the ladder.

Background: The Channel of Transformation carries an energetic potential
through which people with talent or ability can pull themselves up by their
bootstraps, and move out of the social class they were born into. Gate 32 is always on the lookout for
talent. It is driven by the fears that its Tribe may not be the best, or will be unable to survive the next
economic downturn and will not endure. This recognition of the fragility of the Tribe’s existence
shapes Channel 54-32’s ambition; its desire to rise up and transform. There is also a mystical thread,
the thread of spirit, woven into it through Gate 54's 4th line: Enlightenment/Endarkenment, the fuel
for transformation at its purest level.

Personal: Rooted in and grounded by the Tribe’s dedication to service and self-sacrifice,
transformation is best defined here in its Tribal context. Tribal support begins when your talents are
recognized, and your efforts are encouraged, through what is reflected back to you by those you have
helped to fulfill their ambitions or attain enlightenment. Your reward for loyalty and dedication to
the Tribe comes through each promotion to the next level. You willingly work harder than anyone
else to prove your worth or value, even to the point of becoming a workaholic. Your true goal is
to experience this drive for recognition as a healthy interdependence that is mutually beneficial.
Your instincts have the potential to bring you to a vocation through which you might fulfill your
potential, achieve your ambitions, and utilize your gift for making money so that you can use your
unique abilities to assist others in reaching their potential.

Interpersonal: The ambition that constitutes transformation in the material world is guided by
Splenic awareness. It’s by instinct that one with this channel recognizes if or when needed support is
available for increasing one’s wealth, or to ensure success through personal advancement. The pressure
to make more money continually transforms the world economy. In the end, only transformation
that endures over time has value, and creating such continuity requires the support of the Tribe.
Even in today’s global society, supportive allies are crucial for a nation to realize its financial goals
and ambitions. Transformation is not something that we do on our own, and moving up the ladder
is always dependent upon and accompanied by the expectations of those above us. If a person with
Channel 54-32 is properly recognized and supported by the Tribe, then the Tribe expects guid pro
quo, a reciprocal return for what it has provided. This is how the Tribal system endures.

Gate 54 provides humanity with the fuel and ambition to transform the Tribe’s material direction
and standing among other tribes. It supplies the energy for our most mundane ambitions, and
the highest spiritual aspirations that may be hidden within them. Only when we have mastered
our instincts to thrive on the mundane plane, is transformation of a spiritual nature possible.
You live your spiritual ideals through the mundane plane, and ambition is the fulfillment of your
personal potential. If you are noticed by someone higher up in the hierarchy, there is a good
chance that you can better your position in life. Your inner drive to ‘rise up’ provides the impetus
for transformation for those around you as well; it levels the playing field for others to compete on
equal terms. Your drive needs direction, however, so you naturally look to someone with Gate 32
to channel your ambitions toward something of lasting value. Without this direction, your drive
may turn into blind ambition.

~The only thing which endures is change —
Center: Spleen Quarter: Duality Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Maia —JC of Conservation — LAC of Limitation

Awareness through Gate 32 is focused on constant evaluation as an instinctive recognition of
what can and cannot be transformed. An underlying fear of failure can put the brakes on runaway
ambition. Gate 32's ability to adapt, and yet maintain its true nature, is the Spleen’s contribution
to the material continuity of the Tribe. This is part of your contribution as well. A great deal rests
on what is recognized and valued, and thereby encouraged and retained by the Tribe. One of
your gifts is recognizing who has the skills or education to move up in the world; and then, using
your influence, to bring them to the attention of those in positions of authority. This is the gate
of prolonged indecision. You are apt to find yourself agonizing over how to maintain a balance
between what is working successfully (conservatism), and opening yourself or an organization up to
the unknown risks (fear of failure) that accompany transformation and change. Change is inevitable,
however, and when it becomes part of the equation for life, growth is optimized. By relying on your
Authority for timing, and staying closely attuned to your own instincts, your wisdom will emerge
over time as ways to keep society from repeating what does not work, while also embracing what has
lasting value. Without Gate 54 the 32nd gate senses its lack of a consistent source of fuel or drive
or ambition to succeed.

THE CHANNEL OF SURRENDER: 44 - 26
A Design of a Transmitter
Circuit: Ego (Creative Channel) Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Surrender links the Splenic Center to the Heart Center
through the Gate of Alertness (44) and the Gate of the Egoist (26). Here we
find deep Tribal memory, rooted in instinctual awareness/intelligence, joined
to ego strength. It is this combination that gives a transmitter the ability to
selectively and persuasively use historical memory, and guarantee that it will
be an improvement, in order to sell something to a targeted group of people.
Channel 44-26 is the capitalist engaged in the creative art of enterprise.

Background: As the only direct link between the Heart Center and the
Splenic Center, Channel 44-26 forms one of the main health networks
in the body. The 26th gate correlates to the Thymus Gland where our immune system is formed
prenatally. Essentially, this channel is instinctually alert for and willing to address whatever poses a
threat, or needs improving or replacing in order to keep the Tribe viable. Those with the Channel of
Surrender, using their nose or sense for what people may need, have the will to manipulate the tribe
for its own good, even before it knows it needs it.

Personal: You have a gift for instinctually assessing others, and for matching them with products,
jobs, and even ideologies. In exchange for this work, you will demand what you feel is fair for
yourself, and it must include a healthy balance of rest and work. You are not one who is designed to
work eight hours a day in an office, but will accomplish more in a compressed amount of time than
most people will in the entire day. You can trust your instinct to guide you in life, and if something
about a person or a project you are dealing with doesn't ‘smell’ right, don’t engage with them.

‘The shape of the bargain is different on the left side of the Ego Circuit than on the right. It changes
from, “I will do this for you if you do this for me,” to “I am selling this amazing new gadget, and if
you want it, it’s yours for only $12.95.” You are an entrepreneur who is part of a team, and all the
team members must be paid. You are the promoter/salesperson on the frontline, bringing in money
that is then apportioned down the line to each member of the production team. Whether the team
likes you (and your tactics) or not, is dependent on the resources you generate for them. This channel
often works best when you wait until the market or your tribe recognizes your gifts, pledges its
support to you, and asks you to promote yourself or your product on their behalf. This recognition
gives you a platform from which to speak — especially if you are a politician.

Interpersonal: Transmitters intuit which form of persuasion will effectively relay their message,
and they can spontaneously adjust their advertising or sales pitch to meet changing markets and
situations. The creative gifts of this channel include a sense of what will appeal to the Tribe, and
how to manipulate or massage the egos of others into wanting what they are selling. This can
be a valuable asset for the filmmaker, sales representative, graphic designer, advertising executive,
politician and diplomat.

GATE 44: COMING TO MEET - THE GATE OF ALERTNESS
—The success of any interaction is based on the absence of any preconditions —
Center: Spleen Quarter: Duality ‘Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of the Four Ways — JC of Alertness — LAC of Incarnation.

Gate 44 is the gate of memory, and remembers the patterns for living that have successfully provided
for our material needs. This memory is an integral and consistently trustworthy part of our survival
intelligence as a species. You are instinctually alert in every moment for the correct spontaneous
relationship or interaction that can move a potential to the level ofa possibility. What you remember or
transmit shapes the Tribes’ material orientation, and eventually strengthens its ego presence and power
in the world. You control the way Gate 26 is going to act in terms of selling, defending or fighting for
the tribe. This is where tribal propaganda can be found. You help the Tribe to allay its fears of the past
by remembering that a starving child is not a healthy child, and that material security and health go
hand in hand. When you share your awareness and are recognized by the tribe, Gate 26 in the Heart
Center picks up the future potential based on your Splenic memory, and makes it available through the
power of the ego to the Tribe. The Spleen is not a motor, so you look to the will of the Heart Center to
fulfill whatever transformation you instinctively know needs to become a reality if we are to insure the
Tribe’s survival. Without Gate 26 you can unnecessarily exaggerate by over-committing and making
promises you cannot keep. What you fear most is that baggage from the past might catch up with you.

Center: Heart Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of Rulership — JC of Trickster — LAC of Confrontation

Gate 26 is where memory is manipulated, or where the past is selectively remembered, in order to
persuade or distract us from our fears. The line between the truth and a lie blurs, and potential and
possibility are transformed into reality and ‘sold’ to the public — for a price. You are a natural salesperson
who is actually expected to exaggerate, and your innate ability to manipulate memory, coupled with the
energy of your ego, is designed to withstand rejection. If you are recognized for these skills, given a job
where you can set your own schedule, are sufficiently rewarded materially, and can maintain a healthy
balance between rest and work, you are eager to be on the front lines for the Tribe and have the ego to
do it. Waiting to be recognized, and only making promises that you can keep, allows you to maintain
your influence with others. Staying in integrity in terms of how you sell to the tribe, through following
your Strategy and Authority, actually strengthens your ego and your physical heart’s health. Without

Gate 44's instinctive awareness, it can be difficult to know how, when, and what to effectively transmit.

THE CHANNEL OF SYNTHESIS: 19 - 49
A Design of Sensitivity
Circuit: Ego Channel Type: Projected

‘The Channel of Synthesis links the Root Center to the Solar Plexus Center
through the Gate of Wanting (19) and the Gate of Principles (49). Tribal
forms of mysticism evolved through the pressure of humanity’s need for
food, shelter, protection, territory, something to believe in, and something to
hold everything together. The 19th gate pressures us to approach each other
and manifest the interrelatedness of the Tribe, while the 49th gate prods us

=A to reject that which is not compatible with our highest ideals, and supportive

of our connection to each other and spirit.

Background: Sensitivity to need is rooted in touch, such as sealing the bargain
with a handshake, and is found on the emotional side of the Ego Circuit in the realm of belonging.
‘This sensitivity is the Tribe’s foundation for marriage and bonding, and for divorce. The emotional
acceptance or rejection frequency of Channel 19-49 is the glue that determines who belongs and is
deserving of the support of the Tribe; who gets to come to the table and who doesn't. There is nothing
logical (democratic) or abstract (experiential) in this frequency, and it cannot simply be super-imposed
on the Tribe as forcing it won't work. The code of the Tribe, expressed as “love, honor and obey,” is what
bonds the Tribe together. Every member of the tribe owes their life to the life of every other member.
In exchange, one is promised their basic needs will be met. Loyality is one key to the Tribe's survival,
but here that loyalty is governed by an emotional wave.

Personal: You are very sensitive to your own position in the scheme of things. Wanting to be needed
and to give support, and/or needing to be wanted and be supported, is critical to your happiness. The
family, however it is defined, is your enterprise and you are willing to do the necessary inner work
to make it a success. For example, taking time to explore the depth and impact of your emotional
wave on your potential partner through a long courtship, before committing to the intimacy and
responsibility of cohabitation, or marriage and raising a family. The three most important needs
for you within your tribe are the protection of resources, the sanctity of your territory, and a clear
understanding of your tribe’s belief system. Your potential gift is to be recognized as someone who
can always balance practicality and fairness.

Interpersonal: Channel 19-49 begins the evolution of social communion by establishing the
principles for the marriage relationship (which is later cemented by the marriage bond in Channel
37-40, the Channel of Community.) As the archetype of the bride and groom, this channel has a
frequency that holds the family together; it is the origination point for the Tribe’s unifying traditions,
rituals and celebrations. The tradition of the dowry, for example, provides a material foundation for
the union so the couple can focus on producing and raising offspring. ‘The Root Center exerts pressure
through Gate 19 to connect to others in ways that bring joy and happiness. When dominated by
the not-self, this channel is characterized by constant and inappropriate rejection, both of self and
others. Channel 19-49 forms a cross-species connection between mammals and humans, enabling
us to domesticate and train them to work the land, be companions, and provide us with food. This
connection is also where we find the ritual sacrifice of animals to appease the gods and gain favor.

GATE 19: APPROACH - THE GATE OF WANTING
—That all things are interrelated is apparent and manifested through the action of approach —

Center: Root Quarter: Mutation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Transformation
RAC of the Four Ways — JC of Need — LAC of Refinement

Gate 19 fuels two essential human mandates: the need to have access to basic resources like food and
shelter, and the need for spirit. These mandates set us up to interact or bond with others in specific
ways. When everyone has enough to eat, a place to live and a god to worship, we experience life as
one healthy community, supporting each other and making our unique contribution to the whole.
When there is want or need or great inequality in our tribe, communal support breaks down and
nothing works. You are here to be alert and sensitive to which resources are being withheld from
your family, community and eventually the global community. You bring others to an awareness
of what resources are needed for everyone to survive, as well as thrive and achieve their personal
or communal potential. The way you go about this depends on the specific line(s) defined in your
chart, but the process usually requires enticing or bargaining with the people or institutions who
share your principles, and possess or control what is needed. You know what is needed, and you look
to Gate 49 to fulfill those needs. The consequences of turning the Root Center's pressure inward
instead include oversensitivity, an addiction to being needed, or personal neediness as in “Doesn't

Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Explanation - JC of Principles — LAC of Revolution

‘The principles of acceptance and rejection, marriage and divorce, and ultimately revolution, are the
direct result of living with Tribal hierarchies influenced by the emotional wave. Because Gate 49
places you at the top of one of these hierarchies, you feel a need to be obeyed. This translates into you
exerting the power to accept or reject a person, or their request for access to your resources, or their
appeal to initiate a revolution on their own or someone else’s behalf. Your sensitivity or insensitivity
towards other people (and animals), and their specific needs, is based on a resonance with your
own principles. In other words, the people you accept into your circle are those willing to stand by
you and support your principles; the rest you will be inclined to reject. Yours is a social agenda for
change and reformation. It is particularly focused on food and food distribution; people who have
enough to eat don't need to go to war. Revolution is either avoided by filling needs, or entered into
as a necessary evil and last resort. You might be the one whose acceptance or rejection influences
which road is taken to satisfy the needy party. What makes you nervous are the fear of rejection and
the consequences of unpredictability.

THE CHANNEL OF COMMUNITY: 37 - 40
A Design of a Part seeking a Whole
Circuit: Ego Channel Type: Projected

The Channel of Community links the Solar Plexus Center to the Heart
Center through the Gate of Friendship (37) and the Gate of Aloneness
(40). Community lies at the heart of humanity's successful evolution. The
organic nature of community, and the transition point it provides between
the struggle to survive and liberation from that struggle, is subject to the
push-pull of the emotional wave. Gate 40 is willing to work to provide for
those it loves, but it needs its rewards and its rest. Gate 37, with its gift of
affection, is always looking for recognition and its place within the whole.

Background: In the Channel of Community, the Tribal bargain is backed by
the energy of two powerful motors that give it depth through clarity over time, and the will power
to succeed. In community, the bargain must be entered into correctly. The bond of community or
family, and the way the bond will manifest in the future, is guaranteed by the will power behind the
bargain. The alignment of the Ego and Solar Plexus Centers also means that no good bargain can
be struck spontaneously, and must be carefully considered and formulated over time to be equally
beneficial for both parties. Channel 37-40 is an opposition in the Mandala and so is quite common.
It has had tremendous evolutionary influence worldwide, during this present Earth Cycle (1610-
2027), where we have all felt its impact through the Right Angle Cross of Planning.

Personal: If defined by Channel 37-40, you are waiting to see who asks you to be part of their
organization or community, or not. You are also trying to discover where you belong, or how you fit
into the big picture spiritually. The correct invitation won't come through impersonal contact though,
like a phone call, but rather through some form of ‘touch,’ or direct personal contact over a period of
time. In the most basic sense, every human being is existentially alone and yet, for practical purposes,
you are the one who forms the bridge for individuals to live in a community where all have an honored
place and respected function. You understand the importance of making a good bargain, and how to
seal that bargain. “I'll do this for you if you'll do that for me. Let's shake on it, or sign here.”

Interpersonal: A strong, adaptable and clear bargain is needed if the Channel of Community, the
channel of the marriage bond, is to hold the provider and distributor together in a harmonious
relationship. On this side of the Ego Circuit, the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, not his
wallet. On the emotional/social side of the BodyGraph, support is expressed not by things money
can buy, but by what it takes to work side by side and to progress communally. Investment is focused
not on stocks and bonds, but on each other and on the needs of the whole group. This is the highest
ideal of community, and there is little evidence of hierarchy. No one feels superior or inferior because
everyone willingly contributes what they can in order to be included, and to feel supported by and
loyal to a group greater than themselves.

~The manifestation macro and micro-cosmically of the organic nature of communities —
Center: Solar Plexus Quarter: Initiation Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Mind
RAC of Planning - JC of Bargains — LAC of Migration

Gate 37 is the most communal gate in the BodyGraph. When your power is recognized by others,
you can hold both a family and a community together with your warmth, friendliness and nurturing
nature. You have an ability to make an emotional connection with others through touch, and an
uncommon sensitivity which senses their accessibility or openness to you. People will want you to be
their organization's representative, and to welcome the newcomer or stranger. It is an offer that you
might happily agree to if the bargain, or what you receive in return, is sufficient and clearly agreed
upon by all parties. Gate 37 is the gate of the mouth so the planning, gathering and preparing of
food often play a central role in all your family and community gatherings. In the bargain between
Gates 37 and 40, Gate 40 is the willing provider and you are the distributor of its assets and skills.
Without Gate 40, you are looking for those who can deliver the resources needed by the community
so that you have someone to bargain with, and something to distribute. What you most fear is
getting trapped in or having to live up to the traditional Tribal roles.

Center: Heart Quarter: Duality Theme: Purpose fulfilled through Bonding
RAC of Planning —JC of Denial — LAC of Migration

Gate 40 is one of three gates of aloneness (12 and 33 are the other two), and carries a sense of
being alone even when in a group of people. This aloneness is the beginning of the individuation
process; you need to separate yourself from the Tribe. In essence, it is the desire within you for
wholeness, expressed and experienced by others as your strong independence, or as stepping away
from their interdependence. This is an aspect of the ego's willpower that is essential to the survival
of community. Gate 40 is the love of work, and when you are involved in work that is correct for
you, you derive great satisfaction from delivering what you promised to an appreciative Tribe. The
relationship bargain needs to be renegotiated often and kept crystal clear. Yes, you are willing to
work and to exert your ego’s will power to provide for your family or community, but they get access
to your earned resources only if they keep their side of the bargain. They need to show appreciation
and loyalty for your efforts and support you emotionally, feed you, give you time alone to rest, and
take care of you with the resources you provide for them. Without Gate 37, you may find yourself
looking for friendship, and a community to offer your ego's willing provisions to.

THE CHANNEL OF MONEY: 21 - 45
A Design of a Materialist
Circuit: Ego Channel Type: Manifested

The Channel of the Money Line links the Heart Center to the Throat
Center through the Gate of the Hunter/Huntress (21) and the Gate of the
Gatherer (45). The heart of the Tribe, of our life together on the planet, is
the Ego Center with its connection to the heart muscle. This is the Tribe’s
solitary voice, and it expresses its authority and will to survive on the material
plane as a hierarchy.

Background: Channel 21-45 is the most driven of all Manifestor channels
and says, “It’s up to me to take charge, to be in control or not.” The most
benevolent expression of Tribal leadership is to gather, protect and educate
the tribe so that it survives. When everyone has been provided enough support to enjoy life together,
there is peace in the kingdom. Gate 45, the Tribe's only voice, is the voice of authority and the final
voice of what is or isn’t manifested. Its keynote says it well: “I have or I don't have.” The Tribe has
always coveted access to resources (money), and a reliable commitment (loyalty). In manifesting its
pursuit of these desires, and mediated by the bargain, the Tribe has dominated the affairs of human
history. The two gates that make up Channel 21-45 are not easily reconciled to each other. Gate 45
protects but wants the last word, and Gate 21 serves but needs to be in control in order to guarantee
its heart can rest, and/or to guarantee that others get their rest. Historically, this need for a balance
between work and rest was the impetus behind unions ensuring workers’ rights.

Personal: You are here to embrace and master the material plane, and to make money through the
power of your will. Your challenge is to exert your will in a way that protects your own interests, while
still serving others. Having control and not being controlled are issues for you, and the secret to your
success lies in attaining a measure of independence. You are willing to work hard, but you work best
when you are your own boss and can follow your own natural rhythm by controlling what you do and
when you do it. Even when you are not in control of everything around you, you need to feel as though
you are, such as acting as both the CEO and President of the company. It can be difficult for you to rely
on people and delegate responsibility, which can add to your work load and stress your heart.

Interpersonal: Materialists like putting money to work. To become masters of the material plane
and provide for the good of their tribe, they need their tribe’s full support and cooperation. We
can see this in action as we follow the evolution of our economic structures from simple trading
between villages to the complex corporate business models and stock markets of today. The Channel
of Money is actually much more successful as an electromagnetic connection between two people.
‘The 45th gate owns the factory but doesn’t work there. The 21st gate is the president with a large,
active ego who says, “I must benefit myself but at the same time I must benefit the owner and
our constituents.” Together they control or manage the organization so that everyone achieves a
measure of financial success. Another example would be Gate 21 as the prime minister in charge
of running the country and advocating for the people, with Gate 45 as the king who conveys his
authority to the prime minister and must be paid his due.

RAC of Tension — JC of Control — LAC of Endeavor

‘The 21st gate needs to be in control of its domain. In order to apply the strength and will of its ego
to insure the survival of the Tribe, it must have control over something or someone. In our modern
world, this energy translates into the responsibilities given to the police, or managing director or president
of a company. Biting Through is a powerful conditioning force for life on the material plane. You are
successful when you can control your own material resources, where you live, what you wear, whom you
work for and how you make your living. You do not like to be told what to do or to have people looking
over your shoulder. On the other hand, you are destined to serve others because in a Tribal bargain all
must benefit if you are to benefit yourself: If you attempt to assume power, or to control others without
following your Strategy and Authority, you will encounter forceful resistance. Regardless of the benefits
of your intentions, you must wait until you are offered control. If you are a Projector, you need to be with
people who recognize and invite your ability to control; if you are a Generator, you have to be asked for
access to your Sacral energy so you can respond; and if you are a Manifestor, you have to inform before
you attempt to exert control and thus measure the resistance field. Without Gate 45 you will find yourself
searching for a situation in which you can oversee the future and wealth of the community.

Gate 45 is the gate of dominance. It is the gate of the Master/Mistress or King/Queen. It is the single
voice of the Tribe, “I have,” and a deeply possessive gate of manifestation and action. The Gate of the
Gatherer is here to protect the Tribe’s material resources. You are a natural authority and guide for the
Tribe, however, you are not really here to work. When what you ‘have’ is used on behalf of those you
protect, there is peace in your kingdom. You have an ability to gather people together to manifest what
the tribe needs, to expand your community, and to bring harmony to those around you, although the
actual management of the Tribe’s business is handled by Gate 21. You own the land, but you must give
Gate 21 permission to hunt on it, while still demanding that you receive the best piece of meat in the
bargain. When you attempt to tell Gate 21 how to run your kingdom, or when Gate 21 tries to get
the best piece of meat for itself, there is tension. Each gate has its specific role and purpose within the
Tribe, and operates optimally when kept in its place. Even with Gate 21 in your own design, it works
best for you to have the help of another Gate 21 to manage and run your kingdom or business.

THE 12 PROFILES

THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE

We now arrive at another basic component of Human Design. Profile is the beginning of
establishing a style for life, a role described as the costume of our purpose. It is a costume we grow
into, however, and can either be uncomfortable, if distorted by our not-self, or feel like our natural
skin and the true role we are here to live out. Profile is also one of the aspects that differentiates
you as a unique being. You may be an emotional Generator, for instance, sitting with three other
emotional Generators, but if you have different profiles you are very different people. Together
with our Incarnation Cross (see Section Eight), Profile allows us to live our purpose as our own
authentic character on the stage of our life.

‘The basis of profile is the recognition of the fundamental duality that exists within each of us. We
are a binary consciousness, a synthesis of a Personality consciousness and a Design consciousness,
and within Profile we are able to understand the quantum of the two. There are 12 basic profiles,
each of which is derived from a combination of the Line level definition of the conscious Personality
Sun (black) and ‘the unconscious Design Sun (red). This is illustrated in the graphic below. Our
specific interpretation of our Profile, the role our character plays, makes our life performance
unique from all others. And the drama, the movie, begins at birth.

PROFILE STRUCTURE

is of Profile is the Hexagram. The 64 Hexagrams (Gates in the Bodygraph) each have six
Lines, giving us a deeper level of differentiation than the Gates (hexagrams) themselves. The key to
understanding Profile, and why there is such incredible differentiation in the way in which human
beings live out their lives, is found in understanding the lines. The basic structure of a hexagram is
divided into two parts, the Lower Trigram (Lines 1,2,3) and the Upper Trigram (Lines 4,5,6). The
line structure flows from Line 1 at the bottom of the hexagram upwards (see illustration below).

these primary roles. The qualities of these two roles are lived or experienced differently through our
Personality, who we think we think we are, and our Design, our innate nature. Together, they form
a quantum, and the costume for how we live our life in the world.

HEXAGRAM STRUCTURE/HOUSE METAPHOR

It is helpful to use the house as a metaphor for
understanding the six lines and their qualities. The 1st line
is the foundation upon which the house is built. ‘The 2nd
line is the living space on the first floor of the house, with
curtains wide open, that others on the street look into. The
3rd line is the transitional space or spiral staircase moving
from the first to second floor. The 4th line is the second
story, or second floor foundation of the house. The 5th line
is the mysterious, curtained second story window with
expectant speculators outside. And the 6th line is the roof
of the house, with a bird’s eye view into the next house, the
1 rest of the neighborhood and beyond.

PRIMARY ROLES BY LOWER TRIGRAM: LINES 1 —3

‘The lower trigram is a very self-absorbed process, very personal. These are roles that are not rushing out
to externalize, and don’t particularly want to have much to do with others.

LINE 1 - INVESTIGATOR: INTROSPECTION, CHAMELEON, EMPATHY
Line 1 is the ground floor or base of the hexagram, and 1st lines are driven to investigate
the foundation of things, to discover how life works. Once they have firmly established
a secure foundation, they are able to relax. The more they know, the less they fear, as 1st
lines feel “if we can be secure, everything is possible.” Their insecurity drives them to
seek authorities, and become authorities themselves, and yet pursuit of their investigations is an
introspective process that usually says, “I am busy studying, doing my research, so don’t bother me.”
‘The secure foundations that the 1st line creates are then externalized or universalized by the lines
of the upper trigram. There is also a deeply empathic nature to the 1st line, and its ability to take in
information from the other can be very transformative.

1st lines study behavior. They watch how other people act, and they learn to see which behavior
works and which behavior doesn’t work. When feeling insecure, like a chameleon they'll change
their colors to blend in. They're not actually changing anything, but they’re very good at letting you
see what they think you need to see. The keynote for Gate 10 - Line 1 is Modesty, or the ability
to know one’s place and how to act despite circumstances. 1st lines are very sensitive in this way,
and nothing is more important to them than being able to see that they can navigate on this plane,
and that all is going to be okay. 1st line Designs have a need for a secure physical foundation as
well. The most common not-self feeling for the 1st line is a sense of inferiority, generally because
they do not allow themselves the focused self-absorption that is necessary to fully investigate and
establish a foundation. Strategy and Authority will determine the correct investigations for 1st
lines, and allow them to focus on one thing at a time, which can also relieve a great deal of their
not-self anxiety. “The very nature of a Hexagram, the very construct itself, cannot survive without
a solid foundation.” — Ra Uru Hu
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 257

LINE 2 - HERMIT: THE NATURAL, PROJECTION, DEMOCRAT

Line 2 is like a seed that sits in the drawer for years, waiting for just the right time
to be planted so it can awaken, grow, and produce its unique fruit. While the 1st line
investigates in order to build a foundation, 2nd lines are naturals who do not know
where their innate gifts originate from. 2nd lines are noticed for their natural talents
or genius, and are then ‘called out’ by others who want their gifts to be used in a particular way.
‘These are Hermits, however, that want only to be left alone to do their own thing, their own way.
While 1st lines need others to aid in their investigations, 2nd lines are self-contained and can
feel very uncomfortable when others step into their aura and expect something from them. They
do not want to, and do not even know if they can, explain to you how they do what they do, or
even worse, how you should do it. They behave very democratically because they don't want to be
bothered, or have to invest their energy in taking sides.

‘The natural talent that 2nd lines possess does not respond well to interference of any kind. In our
analogy of the house it is as if they are standing alone in front of the first floor window, lights on,
happily self-absorbed in their own play, and not realizing that they are being observed by those
outside on the street. In fact, 2nd line Personalities generally do not even want to go outside
into the world. They are waiting to receive the correct call, specific to their unique life purpose,
that will allow them to share their true genius with the world. It is only through Strategy and
Authority that the 2nd line will know if call is correct. Fulfillment is very important to the 2nd
line, and if they cannot live up to the projections placed on them, or if they allow themselves to
answer calls that are not correct and that they cannot fulfill, they can suffer greatly and isolate
even more than is natural or healthy. “Just sit by the river; sooner or later something will come by.
‘This is readiness for the unknowable, whatever it may be.”— Ra Uru Hu

LINE 3 - MARTYR: TRIAL AND ERROR, MUTATION, ADAPTION

‘The great gift of 3rd lines is discovering what does not work. As the transition point
between the first and second floors of the house (the personal and the transpersonal), life
bumps into them in every way, or they bump into it, and discover through the trial and
error process how the material plane operates. 3rd lines are our key catalysts of change,
and even though they may at times appear socially inept, and very often feel alone, they are the most
interpersonally adaptable line of the lower trigram, with a natural resilience and tenacity that will
sustain them through their discovery process. A 3rd line is more likely to notice and recognize a
potential new mutation faster than anybody else, simply because they bump into it. Often associated
with scientific exploration (but from the stand-point of what is not working) and deeply material,
3rd lines do not take life at face value. They will kick the tires and look to see where the flaw, the
loophole, or trick is. The 3rd line models for us the transformation that is possible when we are
grounded in our bodies on the material plane.

‘These beings, whose natural gift is challenging the falsehoods, are ultimately mutating the Maia.
‘They're also going to notice what doesn't work in a relationship faster than anybody else, which is
why their theme is ‘bonds made and broken.’ The keynote of Martyr refers to the 3rd line's ability
to stand up and say “this is not true,” and take the heat for it. When operating correctly as true self,
however, there is no such thing as failure for a 3rd line — only discovery. Bonds made and broken
can become a natural mechanism in their life, such as the parent who leaves the house to go to
i)

58 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

work each day and then returns. The 3rd line is also part of the 6th line three-part life process (see
Line 6 — the Role Model), and its mutative quality permeates the Profile roles more than any other
line. “Whatever comes their way, there is always a message with important information. They are the
weavers of the Maia.”— Ra Uru Hu

PRIMARY ROLES BY UPPER TRIGRAM: LINES 4-6

When we move upward into the upper trigram, the mechanics of the roles change entirely. The
upper trigram is a transpersonal, outer-directed process. These roles have an essential need to share
socially with others; to share the past and the possibilities of the future.

LINE 4 - OPPORTUNIST: EXTERNALIZATION, FRIENDLINESS

In harmony with the 1st line, the 4th line represents the foundation of the second
floor of the house, and builds upon the security that the 1st line creates. There is also
a fragility to Line 4 in that it must also allow an opening for the transition into the
upper trigram. While Line 3 is deeply involved with material resources, Line 4 is the
foundation of transpersonal relationships and concerned with human resources. The 4th line is

is typically limited to people with whom they have already established relationships; strangers are not
generally correct for them other than as casual contacts.

Quality of life for 4th lines is in direct proportion to the quality of their network of friends and associates.
Establishing their energies in correct relationships allows them to enjoy a genuine camaraderie. There
is also an inflexibility, however, which creates a tendency toward people burnout for the 4th line, and
they need times of retreat to nurture and rejuvenate themselves. The potential opportunities that their
networks offer must bring a return on the energy investment that they have put into it, or they
may abdicate and find a network that does. 4th lines who are living correctly do not create their
networks, however; their correct networks are already there and they meet them through Strategy
and Authority. The 4th line, having a fixed quality, must transition securely from one network or
relationship to another, or lose its security and true opportunities to influence. “The 4th line is about
the human resources of the material plane; people are the biggest decisions and investments they

make in their life.”— Ra Uru Hu

LINE 5 - HERETIC: UNIVERSALIZING, PROJECTION, THE GENERAL

‘The Sth line carries the responsibility of universalizing the message of the hexagram.
Those with a 5th line carry the most transpersonal karma, and are most effective as a
‘stranger of consequence,’ such as the general who steps in when the standard solutions
have failed and offers a practical yet ‘outside the box’ solution. The auras of 5th lines invite
people in need or crisis to project onto them a potential for rescue. Heretics operate in a projection
field that seduces the other into recognizing the potential power that is there, but 5th lines can also
be very suspicious as others see things in them that are not there, or have expectations of them they

SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 259

cannot meet. The Sth line, peeking out through the curtains of the second story window of the
house, looks out at the world and very often hides from it at the same time. Strategy and Authority
provides a practical and trustworthy tool for determining which situations are correct for the 5th
line to step into to provide a solution.

If unaware of the projection field, 5th lines may be flattered by and believe others’ perceptions
of them as saviors. In order to not buy into the illusions that others may have about them, 5th
lines must be truly aware of themselves and what they are really capable of solving or saving. The
Heretic’s reputation is totally dependent upon the success or failure of their solutions to meet the
other’s expectations. If they have not provided something of real value they may be figuratively
burned at the stake. Once the crisis is past and the Heretics’ leadership is no longer needed, however,
they are generally ignored. This is the 5th line’s natural time to regroup, as Heretics are not on
duty constantly, but are expected to be standing by, ready and able, when the next crisis arrives.
“Whatever you're going to do in this life, make sure it has a practical application. If that’s the case,
you will be a success, whatever it is. But if it’s not, then you have the reputation problem. It follows
you wherever you go.”— Ra Uru Hu

LINE 6 - ROLE MODEL: ADMINISTRATOR, OPTIMIST, PEACEMAKER

The 6th line stands alone from the other five lines of the hexagram, and is best
described as sitting on the roof. Though sometimes perceived as disinterested, this aloof
perspective provides the 6th line with a vantage point from which to look back over the
other five lines, while also looking ahead toward Line 1 of the next hexagram. Whereas
Line 5 is moving toward others, Line 6 eventually moves away from them in order to go through
a unique 3-stage life process and emerge as the mature Role Model.

STAGE 1, from birth to approximately 30 years, is one of exploring and living life through the 3rd line
process of trial and error, and bonds made and broken. Driven to seek a soul mate (a 6th line attribute),
they generally do not until they complete Stage 2 around the age 50. 6th lines are not resilient like
true 3rd lines, however, and the chaotic ‘getting bumped into’ process can lead to disillusionment and a
pessimistic view of life by their late 20's. In order to regain their optimism, they look for a way to retreat
physically and/or emotionally from the world. A 6th line’s first Saturn return at approximately 28 years
marks the climb up on the roof, and the external discovery process shifts to a more internal one.

STAGE 2, from about 30 to 50 years of age, is one of withdrawing from the chaos of the 3rd line
experience in order to heal and reflect. “Going up on the roof” is a time to observe and discover what
is trustworthy and really works in the world; to re-evaluate life and develop the resources they will
need later. Their energy may feel more aloof to others, but they are also beginning to be looked to
for their wisdom. During this time of inner retreat, 6th lines generally feel the most secure as they
start to settle in, choose a vocation, a mate and/or raise a family. Their 3rd line discoveries are now
integrated, and become the foundation for the outer authority they will express as the Role Model.

STAGE 3, begins with the Kiron Return at approximately 50 years of age. They are now nudged or
kicked off the roof to engage fully in the world once more, this time as their authentic, optimistic
6th line self. This can be a time of radical shifts in their lives, and they may be particularly vulnerable
if they do not know how to make decisions as their own authority. The awake Role Model is a living
260 | ____ THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

example of an aware being living a unique purpose. Hypocrisy is very difficult for a 6th line to deal
with. They are deeply trusting beings and model to us how we too can trust our own authority and
live our unique life. By entering deeply into experiences when young, remaining aloof and healing
through inner work in mid-life, and re-engaging and flowering into the world after age 50, 6th
lines bring a unique perspective and wisdom to the way life can work. Theirs is an example of the
transcendent life possible as a 9-centered being. “Every 6th line being carries the magic of the
future, it carries the magic of what’s possible for a human being, what's possible for any human
being if they're fortunate enough in this life to come in contact with this knowledge and they get to
experiment with it and see for themselves.”— Ra Uru Hu

Note: As 9-centered beings, regardless of our particular profile, we all develop slowly. Between age
40 and 50 (between our Uranus Opposition and Kiron Return) we experience a ‘second wind,’ a
reorientation that occurs during the mature chapters of our life. Humanity is evolving away from the
universalizing savior/general 5th line toward the 6th line process of self-leadership and self-mastery
based in self-acceptance and self-awareness. Those with Line 6 in their profile are here to show us
how to make that transition correctly. After age 50, they are here to model transcendence, or what
it is like to live our truth as an authentic, objective and aware human being.

SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 261

As the Sun and Earth progress through each gate and line around the Mandala, during the
course of one year, three distinct geometries are created. Geometries set mechanical potentials
and limitations in motion that frame the specific way(s) we are to interact with and impact others
in order to fulfill our life purpose. Each of the 12 profiles falls into one of three geometries, Right
Angle, Fixed Fate or Left Angle.

RIGHT ANGLE Geometry, which comprises the first seven profiles, creates a self-absorbed,
Personal Destiny. Comprising approximately 64% of the planet, these profiles are here to work
out their own life. Right Angle Geometry is focused on self-exploration and facing the personal
challenges we meet in life. They are not here to be absorbed into someone else’s process. People
whose lives intersect with theirs may spark new experiences, but will not alter their movement
through life. Right Angles are not particularly aware of, nor understand, why they connect to certain
people as these profiles enter an incarnation with the veil drawn over the experiences of their past
lifetimes. They are here to do the research, explore, re-experience and gain new perspectives, and as
such are the creators of karma on the planet.

JUXTAPOSITION GEOMETRY (the 4/1 Profile only) acts a bridge between the Right Angle and the
Left Angle. This is Fixed Fate, neither personal nor transpersonal, and 4/1 Profiles, representing less
than 3% of the population on the planet, are fixed instead in their own line of movement — like a
train on a track. The force of the Fixed Fate profile is that whoever else comes in contact with it, and
stays in contact for an extended time, becomes part of that fate as well.

‘The Juxtaposition Profile is the bridge between the personal Right Angle research and development
department, and the transpersonal Left Angle marketing department.

LEFT ANGLE Geometry is Trans-Personal and has a trajectory or path that has many intersecting
lines. These four profiles, representing 33% of humanity, cannot fulfill their purpose alone. Although
not dependent on the other, even the simplest of connections can potentially change their direction or
path, or the other's, which is the opposite of the Right Angle process. Left Angle profiles have a more
conscious awareness of other people and the world, and are always ready to observe and engage in
life. Trans-Personal profiles maintain a connection to past incarnations, and often feel an unexplained
familiarity with certain people and experiences. While the Right Angle creates karma, the Left Angle
cleans up the karma that has been created.

Your geometry is recorded on your chart as part of your Incarnation Cross; for example, the Right
Angle Cross of Eden, the Juxtaposition Cross of Power or the Left Angle Cross of Dedication. (You

will find a general overview of Incarnation Crosses in Section Eight).

‘the following pages provide in-depth summaries of the 12 profiles. As you read through them,
notice how the same line (Line 1 for instance) may create a different way the role plays out when it
is on the Personality side of the profile (i.e., a 1/3 Profile) as compared to when it is on the Design
side (a 5/1 profile). Line 1 in the Personality will bring conscious recognition, while the same line in
the Design will be more a part of the vehicle’s nature, and unconscious to the Personality.

Background: The geometry of the Personal Destiny trigram begins with the 1/3 profile — the first
of the 12 roles, and the personification and foundation of our human experience. The 1/3 is unique
in that it is the only profile with both lines in the lower trigram. At this foundational level, the
1st line represents the conscious Personality, the mind and how we think. The 3rd line represents
the unconscious Design, the body, and our physical experience in the mundane world. We are a
species that is driven by fear for our survival to investigate until we understand or find security
through a solid foundation. This is not always possible in the ever-changing world that we live in,
but the search for this security drives and mutates our species forward. Mutation is the continual
process of finding out what does not work so that we can survive. The 1/3 sets the theme for the
on-going ‘human journey of bumping into, investigating what we bump into, and resolving and
understanding the unknown.

Investigator Martyrs, very insecure when not standing on a solid foundation, are driven to seek
authorities that can provide them with secure grounding for their trial and error process. Their self-
absorbed Investigator Personalities are very creative, and are healthiest and most productive when
well prepared and well educated. They enjoy their long hours of introspection, and find strength in
eventually establishing themselves as an authority so that their personal destiny remains in their own
hands. Their Martyr Vehicles or bodies are designed to discover how to navigate the material plane
by bumping into things, or being bumped into, literally and figuratively. Adaptable and resilient,
they are able to pick themselves up and announce to the world the truth of what does not work.

Personal: You are consciously focused on finding inner strength by establishing a secure foundation,
while your unconscious Design naturally bumps into things that continually surprise you and others
with ‘accidental’ discoveries. You have a deeply internal destiny and can be like a chameleon, not
wanting to draw too much attention to yourself until you feel secure as an authority. Gray areas can
make you feel weak and uncomfortable, and drive you to seek answers. An open and willing student,
you are on a path to develop strength through mastery.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 263

You are here to be in charge of your own life, as well as a voice and person of authority in your
field of expertise. Learning about relationships is a lifelong trial and error journey for you as you
travel along, head down and absorbed in introspection, and yet bumping into people along the way.
When something about a relationship isn’t secure or harmonious, you can become uncomfortable
and break the bond. You will then renegotiate the bond, either strengthening the relationship or
bringing it to an end. This can happen repeatedly, and is the correct way that your relationships are
deepened and kept healthy, or brought to completion so you can move on to one that works.

In addition, your Martyr side has a tendency to look at all of life as a potential untruth, even while
your Investigator side is seeking a solid truth to build its authority around. You cannot be lied to,
and even as a child you quickly found out who was telling you the truth and what you could trust.
If you can surrender, your Strategy and Authority will guide you correctly through life, as your 1st
line Personality augments the trial and error process with further investigation. It’s also important
that you have control over your environment as you have to be free to progress organically from one
discovery to the next. You are empowered when encouraged to investigate or speak the truth about
what does not work.

Interpersonal: Martyrs are often blamed for mistakes that aren’t even theirs, which can undermine
their self-esteem and create an ‘us against then’ mentality, feelings of shame, or an inferiority
complex. If they, and those around them, understand that life is simply a constant and necessary
process of trial and error, ending in discoveries that can then support a solid foundation, they can
find strength in their journey. The focus must always be on what was learned from the experience,
rather than the perception that they have made a mistake for which they are to be punished or
ridiculed. This is the positive reinforcement that is especially important when raising a 1/3 child.
When properly encouraged, the moment a 1/3 child finds out that the foundation does not work ,
there is the potential for wonderfully artful and creative discoveries to happen.

Even though they may seem stubborn or resistant to taking the advice of others, in truth, 1/3’s
must do it for themselves through direct experience in order to discover and learn. Parents can be
their strongest allies, encouraging them to “try” it, and then fostering a “tell me what you learned”
attitude, rather than “look what you did wrong.” This allows 1/3’s to learn through discovery, which
encourages them to continue this process throughout their life, and allows them to ultimately
contribute to humanity, and improve life for all of us. The only true failure for a 3rd line is to not
learn from their trial and error process. Investigative Martyrs can become secure self-providers on
the material plane when encouraged to take charge of themselves.

The chain of 12 profiles begins with a 1/3 and ends with a 6/3. The 3rd line themes of mutation,
trial and error, discovery, bumping into things, and bonds made and broken, are important and
prominent in humanity. These are themes of the mundane world that bind us all together and keep
our species evolving. All 6th lines live a 3rd line process in the first 30 years of their life, therefore,
half of the 12 profiles carry a 3rd line theme. The 3rd line is designed to operate in the density of the
material world, and within that world we discover who we are.

Background: The combination of the Investigator and Opportunist weaves introspection together
with a natural gift for establishing close relationships. 1/4’s have an inner urge to creatively externalize
their investigative findings to people they know. While the conscious Investigator is focused on
getting to the bottom of what makes things work, the transpersonal Opportunist is looking for ways
to get that knowledge out. To do so they make friends with people, as part of a personal network that
will ultimately become the recipients of their message. Investigative Opportunist’s have a special
platform from which to influence others, for once they secure a solid foundation and connect with
a network, they become engaging authorities themselves.

‘There is something very special about this Profile as both the 1st line and 4th lines are in ‘harmony’
with each other, and even though they operate in different ways, both are ‘foundation lines. The 1st
line establishes the ground floor foundation of the house, and the 4th line is the foundation for the
second floor. This is a special circumstance in that both lines of the Profile are essentially interested
in the same thing. There is a harmony between what they investigate and what they externalize,
and what they want to externalize is what they want to investigate. Harmony Profiles (1/4, 2/5, 3/6,
4/1, 5/2, 6/3) are a minority in the population, and play a role in the world as innocent agents of
transition by bridging information and the other 6 Profiles to each other.

Personal: You are here to grasp the foundation of whatever you are interested in at a very deep level,
and to take this knowledge base and externalize it to your network. You are driven to seek authorities
that can teach you and prepare you, so that eventually you can establish yourself as an authority in a
field or topic that intrigues you. As you emerge into the world as an authority, your insecurity turns
into security and provides you with a solid foundation to stand on. You move from a position of
weakness to one of strength, and you can be a force of strength for others as well. In order to delve
deeply you need time alone, as your chameleon-like introspection allows you to submerge yourself’
into what you are investigating. You are not communally creative, and instead enjoy creative solitude
which is very healing and brings richness to your life.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 265

Your natural friendliness is also an intimacy strategy that attracts listeners and eventually partners.
What you are looking for is a confidante, and lasting relationships begin by building friendships
first. When following your Strategy and Authority you are very clear in your introspective process
of investigation, and wait for the correct opportunity to tell others about what you have learned and
discovered. You aren't just learning for yourself, or for its own sake, but with an eye toward attracting
those who might be interested in and benefit from the information. In fact, you do not have to
discover or experience something personally before you are willing to share it with others.

Investing in and maintaining your network is one of the most important things that you do in life.
Your investment in people brings future opportunities to express your knowledge base. Knowing
how to make decisions in terms of which people to invest in is crucial to your wellbeing; investing
in the wrong networks and people is detrimental and leads to burnout and fatigue. All of your
new associations need to come to you through an introduction by your network; you are not
designed to influence strangers. Your 1st line Investigator is not concerned with the other, and
your friendly 4th line Opportunist is unconscious, therefore, the only way for you to know who
is correct for you is through your Strategy and Authority. Your opportunities in life come from
networks and people you know, and it is important that you never leave one thing, such as a job,
lover, or home until you have something else to take its place. If you do, you will have a hard time
finding a replacement.

Retreating from your network at times is also crucial in order to recover from the fatigue resulting
from your social networking. You can exhaust yourself listening to others as it takes considerable
time and energy to cultivate your network as you wait for your opportunity to tell your truth.

Interpersonal: The 1/4 profile is the conscious authoritarian and the unconscious abdicator.
Investigator Opportunists don’t handle resistance well from others, and when they meet someone
who rejects their influence they will abdicate without changing their position, and simply move
on to find someone else willing and open to listening to them. The quality of a 4th line’s life is
dependent on the quality of the network. They are very powerful and influential people, fixed like an
oak tree, who project an aura of strength and authority. Opportunists who are living authentically,
however, do not create their networks — they meet them through Strategy and Authority.

1/4’s are looking for support, and are dependant on others until they can get to a point in life where
they become an authority providing for themselves. Once on solid ground, they are then in control
of their own life, and get their opportunity to be generous and caring benefactors for others in
return. As children they will simply believe whatever they are told. It is important for parents of
1/4’s to only give them truthful information that they themselves are sure of. It can be devastating
for a 1/4 child to find out later that they were lied to. 4th lines can also express a mean side when
provoked that can come back to haunt them. Though it seems impossible to change a 1/4’s mind
about a deeply held understanding, this same fixedness combined with empathy toward others is
what brings transition and evolution to our tribal and collective foundations.

Background: Within the hexagram, Lines 1 and 2 represent the first of three yin/yang binaries,
and although these two lines operate differently, each is concerned with insecurity. To deal with
this, the 1st line investigates and studies, and the 2nd line eventually learns to trust its natural gifts
that require no study. There is an innate tension between this Hermit Personality that wants to be
left alone to do its own thing, and the Opportunist Design that wants to connect with others to
externalize something. The conscious 2nd line is inherently shy and unaware of its gifts, and has
to be called out by others in order to share them. The unconscious yet naturally friendly 4th line
provides opportunities for these gifts to be called out by attracting people to the 2nd line.

The Hermit, as much as it would like to be invisible to the other, is actually very transparent. Others
look in and see what the Hermit cannot — its natural talents and genius. The Hermit can only see
itself, though, through the projections and feedback of others. Not easily motivated to study like the
1st line, Hermit Opportunists are happiest when completely absorbed in their secure environment
doing what they enjoy most. And while they are happily dancing to their own beat, they attract the
attention of others who call them out to share their essential nature.

Personal: You are a natural who is here to be called out by others to share your innate talents and
genius. You have a built-in barrier, such as a limited point of view, that protects you and your unique
genius from being corrupted by outside interference. This barrier has a ‘weak’ spot, a place where it
can be penetrated. The right call from the right person can lead to profound transformation in your
life, and propel your purpose and destiny out into the world with a missionary’s zeal. You don't like
to be called out all the time, however, and answering just any call puts tremendous stress on your
body. Improper use of your energy results in fatigue, burnout and eventually exhaustion. Continually
answering the wrong calls turns the 2nd line barrier into a psychological barrier that refuses to hear all
calls, and you will ultimately suffer because of this. When called, you are incredibly impressive as you
seem to be driven by an unseen force on a crusade to externalize your gift to the world. You are being
pushed and motivated by your unconscious transpersonal 4th line, and yet, if your 2nd line had its way
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 267

you would just stay in your protected space, and never choose to be bothered by anyone. Consciously,
you can feel incredibly helpless in the moment of the call, as you are taken out of your protected and
secure environment and pushed out into the world of social interactions. It is crucial that you give
yourself hermit time away from your networks as the solitude brings a delicious sense of harmony to
your life. You are also very particular about your environment and enjoy having things arranged in a
specific way that feels good for you — so you can be left alone to do your own thing. Your cave when
you retreat into it is your sanctuary and castle, a place where you like to be without interruption.

Uncertainty is part of your 2nd line life. Living in a world where people expect you to be able to
explain what you do and how you do it is uncomfortable for you, and even makes you question your
own abilities. If you worry too much about what others think about what you do, you can become
paranoid of the projections of others. Your gift is not something that you can explain; people will
have to accept that you do what you do and you don't know how or why.

Your unconscious 4th line, and your instinct for networking, is the most effective way for attracting
the opportunities for your calling and achieving success and security in the world. You must,
however, also be ‘called’ into the correct networks. When you are in ‘your’ network you feel nourished
and can be nourishing to others; your influence can be contagious and remarkable. As the Hermit
Opportunist, you can move between nourishing and depleting, such as Michelangelo who depleted
his nourishing benefactor’s resources. There is no moral judgment in this dynamic, however, if you
are in the wrong network, you can end up becoming dependent and depleting others’ resources in
an unhealthy way. You are not designed for strangers, and the only way a stranger can reach you
correctly is by being introduced through someone you already know in your network. Knowing how
to make correct decisions is very important as there are very specific calls for you in life, and learning
how to recognize them is crucial to your well-being. Attracting the correct call occurs naturally when
your life is properly aligned by making decisions through your Strategy and Authority. Without this
guidance, life can be chaotic and the life-transforming call may never be heard.

Interpersonal: Hermit Opportunists bond through a strategy of shyness/boldness. Their Hermit
shyness calls out to the other to be bold enough to break down their barrier to intimacy and
establish friendship first. Hermits are only open to specific people, however, and this is how
they enter correctly into intimate and lasting relationships. The 2nd line does not pursue, as the
Hermit is unaware of the quality within that attracts the other, but rather waits for someone to
enter their cave and say, “you are for me.” This is also the correct way for Hermit Opportunists to
enter into business commitments or partnerships, as it is those in their networks who recognize
and most easily call them out.

Even with their inherent and unlearned gifts, 2/4 children need a good education and should be
encouraged and supported to study. This preparation will be invaluable later in life when their call
comes. They need to be ‘turned on’ though to get them involved, and if not interested they won't
want to join in. They are generally easy going and will go along with the majority, but need a balance
between time alone and social time.

Background: In the 2/5 profile, we find the harmony of the two lines of projection. The very personal
Hermit wants to be left alone to do its own thing and is unaware of the projection. The transpersonal
and seductive Heretic is aware and wary of the projections from others, yet needs to interact with
them to fulfill its karmic purpose. The Heretic can in effect call the Hermit into action with an inner
call. The true universalizing call is rare, but ultimately the talents of the Hermit Heretic are correctly
called out when the projections that it attracts can be met by the practical solutions that its natural
genius provides. The conscious Hermit in its withdrawal, not wanting to be bothered, projects the
attitude of the democrat, and allows others to assume responsibility. The unconscious Heretic is the
Savior waiting for its chance to be able to lead and universalize its practical power.

‘The 5th line is always exalted because it represents the hopes and dreams of humanity. It is also the
most transpersonal of all lines and its impact can be very profound. When someone looks in the
window of a 2/5, they see the possibility of someone who can be called to greatness. Once called, they
can lead any rebellion against any standard at any cost, and provide a practical solution that may be
outside of all previous boxes. At the same time, what people really want is a General who is called upon
only when needed. They want a leader who can step in when there is a crisis, and then step out again.

The Hermit Heretic must also have the loyalty of those it is stepping in to ‘save,’ as well as loyalty
to its own natural passions and talents that are the core of its innate genius. The 2/5 must also
know when to let go of the leadership role and step back into its hermitage. This is important on a
personal level for the 2nd line who must be allowed time to retreat in order to nurture itself, as well
as a transpersonal level for the 5th line whose reputation will suffer when it is not able to meet the
continual projections of others.

Personal: You are someone who craves harmony, and your Hermit, quietly minding its own business,
is startled when your Heretic jumps in to help others. Whenever you step into a room you meet
an expectant audience. There is a double pressure of projection and expectation that your special
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 269

talents can save us in our time of need. You can attract a group or an individual's loyalty, or you can
encounter distrust. Not knowing which of these projections you will meet can be uncomfortable
for you. The call is unavoidable though, even when it may prove more irritating than enlightening.
You are quite capable of leading a revolution — if it is the correct one. Your only real protection is to
follow your Strategy and Authority to determine which calls are correct for you.

The correct call transforms you. Ultimately, your reputation depends entirely on your ability to
provide a practical, universal solution. Neither your Hermit nor your Heretic is very comfortable
in the world, and you can appear reclusive, seeming to withhold or hoard your personal resources.
‘This serves an important purpose, however, as it gives your energy, natural talents and reputation
time to build up in readiness for that moment when you are projected upon to provide practical
solutions when others really need them. Knowing what is practical, and living by it in your own life,
is essential. Your conscious bonding strategy is “I’m shy, you have to break down my barriers to reach
me”, while unconsciously you are always attracting people to you. Your greatest power, however, is
asa stranger of consequence.

Interpersonal: Hermit Heretics that act according to their true nature are going to have chances
in life, especially if they are well educated in something they naturally do well, and can handle the
projection field. They have the potential of being both called, and calling others, and will enjoy the
fruits of the positive projections that result from their ability to bring a practical solution to the
collective. The 2/5 can be deeply creative in the way in which it establishes its persona in the world,
and it excels in its own self-marketing. When the majority is in crisis and the 2/5 receives its call, it
can transform and begin to call others to a new principle.

2/5’s are naturally withdrawn, a valuable strategy for them, as this withdrawal always brings others
into their life to call them out. In this way, the 2/5 is also generally assured, initially at least, of
meeting a positive projection. They struggle to maintain their innocence in life as the projections
pile up, however, and they cannot self-motivate out of desire. They are Heretics who bring change,
and challenge what is already there. If the challenge is practical then their heresy will triumph, and
continue to triumph until it is no longer heresy.

Hermit Heretic children need respect for their boundaries, and they should not be forced to do
something they do not want to do. They can be the most wonderful babies ever, but if they have a
bad day, their reputation even at a young age can suffer. Once they are knocked off the pedestal, they
can stay off of it for a while or for life. Their need for alone time must also be respected, as they feel
very deeply the projections of their parents and others who in some way expect them to be faster or
smarter, or good at this or that.

If their needs are not respected, both the Hermit and the Heretic will rebel. As long as 2/5’s are
following their Strategy and Authority when called into career or relationship, there is tremendous
potential for successfully universalizing something and fulfilling their purpose.

Background: If the theater is on fire, and the fire department has not shown up due to budget cuts,
the person standing in the middle of the theater yelling “This is not right,” while at the same time
organizing a fire brigade and finding all the exits, is the Martyr Heretic. The 3/5 profile combines
two potent agents for change. Resilient, adaptable and mutative, the conscious 3rd line focuses itself
primarily on discovery in the material world, and lives a very physical trial and error process, which
allows it to sustain itself and others with its discoveries. Martyrs are equipped to take the heat when
they stand up and tell the truth about what isn't working, but they are not equipped to meet the
other gracefully. Life bumps into them and they bump into it. Like the 1st and 2nd lines, they are
not looking for anyone. They are, however, looking around at the world in order to be stimulated
and potentially mutate, and end up bumping into all kinds of forces. Some of these forces may not
be correct for it, and so the 3rd line can become pessimistic. Learning to discern at an early age what
works for it or not is very important.

On the other hand, the unconscious but seductive 5th line cannot escape from the other. It
continually attracts projections from those who see the Heretic as the General who can ride in on
the white horse and pull them out of crisis. This can be quite uncomfortable for the 3/5 as from the
time they are born, people project onto them that they can save the day, and then the 3rd line process
kicks in and the one who is here to help can do nothing but make mistakes.

As it matures through life, the 3rd line naturally provides a wealth of experiential wisdom. The 5th
line, the General, will be asked into situations where the Martyr will know and see what does not
work. It can then stand up as the Heretic, take charge, and deliver something new and practical
that does. The anarchistic Martyr will play right along, adapting and experimenting and refining
the process every step of the way. Referred to as the great ‘fixers,’ they provide us with innovative
solutions, help and guidance. The 3/5 profile also needs to know when to relinquish the reins and let
others continue the process themselves. They are not networkers with continual influence like the
4th line, and their greatest power and effectiveness is as a stranger of consequence.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 271

Personal: The hardest thing for you is to reconcile your very natural 3rd line discovery dance
through life with the projections of savior that others place on your unconscious Sth line. For you to
correctly inhabit your role as a Martyr Heretic, your emphasis must be on what is learned when life
bumps into you, as well as how and ‘when to correct ly apply these discoveries. You must have great
discernment when something or someone bumps into you, and determine if it is worthwhile for you
to stay there or not, to bond or not. Your discovery process may feel at times like you have failed, but
your experimentation is a foundation that someone else will build on. There were a thousand ways
the light bulb did not work before they found the way that it did, yet each of those discoveries fed
the next. You are someone who can sustain the trial and error process as you do not give up easily.

Most importantly, you must enter into both your explorations and rescues correctly through your
Strategy and Authority, or you may end up feeling pessimistic about life, or possibly watch your
reputation go up in smoke. When a commitment is made correctly, you can step in with the full
force of your resilience, adaptability, determination, generosity and selflessness, and be sustained by
life no matter how hard it bumps into you. And even if you get burned at the stake, you will just
move on to the next one.

You are here to stand up for a principle, and to change the world around you by bringing a new value
or structure to the collective. You have to be careful though not to end up with a Martyr complex,
saying “why me” or “why now.” You have to discover the principles that you can live by yourself, and
then transform those principles into a universalizing force. You are here to ultimately create a new
principle, a new heresy, but if that heresy is not practical you pay a price. Your work, or any activity
you engage in, needs to be stimulating and not repetitious. Seeing new clients every day, for instance,
can be good for you, as bonds made and broken is your theme.

Interpersonal: Martyr Heretics are masters of the material plane. When things aren't working out,
however, they will break the bond and walk away. Their projected attitude may best be expressed as
“never belong to an organization that would have you as a member.” They are anarchists who must
be willing to break the bond with anything that does not work, in order to finally discover what
does. There is enormous value for everyone to have a 3rd line around who is consciously designed
to discover what does not work. If parents, teachers and others can refrain from calling the 3/5
pessimistic or negative, or telling them that they have made a mistake, they will save themselves
considerable time and energy by making use of the 3/5’s experiential wisdom.

We need to offer a special kind of grace to a 3rd line child. Parents and teachers must allow them to
go through their process with positive reinforcement. “What did you learn from it?” or, “Don't see
it as a mistake, just a process.” If they do not, the psychological damage to a 3/5 child can be great.
When Martyr Heretics cant live up to the expectations projected onto them, they will flee and burn
their bridges behind them. If they can navigate the projection field though, through Strategy and
Authority, then the full potency of their truth, along with their ability to adapt, find a practical way,
and still see the beauty and wonder of the material plane, will shine as a real gift for us all. The only
thing they need to empower this role is positive reinforcement.

Background: When the pessimism of the Martyr meets the optimism of the Role Model, together
they attempt to sort out what they really can trust in life. The 3/6 profile expresses the possibility
that trial and error can lead to wisdom. All 6th lines have a three-stage life process. During the first
30 years they operate as a 3rd line. The Martyr Role Model, therefore, starts out life as a double 3rd
line, deeply involved in experiencing life through one discovery after another, making and breaking
bonds along the way. In Stage 2 (30-50), the Role Model tries to climb up on the roof to take a
break and observe life. The conscious 3rd line continues to re-engage with life, however, pulling the
6th line down into the world again. Neither the 3/6 nor the 6/3 profiles ever really get the pure roof
time that the 4/6 or 6/2 profiles do.

Potentially, the 3/6’s discoveries will be expressed as balanced and mature wisdom in Stage 3 (after
age 50), a time when the 3/6 climbs down off the roof and re-engages completely in life. With its
unique and aloof perspective, the Role Model judges life in terms of what is perfect or not, while
the bumping along in the trenches Martyr discovers what does not work. Together they can stand
up for a truth, and model in different ways the transition possible for humanity if we transcend our
conditioning, embrace our stages of maturing, become our own Authority, and live as our unique,
aware, and authentic selves.

Personal: Trust is a big issue for you, as is perfection, which can put stress on relationships that can't
meet your standards or expectations. When you have trust, you feel secure in life. At the same time,
you are involved in a very natural process of discovery. You make and break bonds, which may not
meld easily with your unconscious motivation to find a soul mate and settle down into the perfect
life you can trust. Your 6th line carries a quality of nobility beyond the mundane, and you can become
disappointed when the perfection is marred and withdraw for a time when life simply doesn’t work
the way you expected it to. You can be a ‘fence sitter’ as indecision is a theme throughout your life.
‘The 3rd line wants to enter into the experience, while the 6th line would rather observe and not
SECTION SEVEr

PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 273

commit itself, Doing something, however, is better than doing nothing. You are designed to gather
experiences, but only the experiences that are correct for you. Relief from the indecision comes when
you have a navigation tool such as Strategy and Authority.

While your 6th line unconscious wants life to be perfect, your conscious 3rd line needs to learn
about perfection through the often-messy trial and error process. When things don’t seem to work,
your 3rd line pessimism can cloud your outlook on life, while the unconscious 6th line wants to
maintain its optimistic nature. Seeing your 3rd line trial and error process as positive rather than
negative, will help you to maintain a more optimistic and objective attitude about life. There are no
mistakes for a 3rd line, only discoveries, which are critical to your development into an experienced
and wise role model. You must be deeply engaged with life, in a hands-on way, in order to learn,
and develop your self-confidence and self-mastery. The journey for you is to recognize the wisdom
of your 3rd line discoveries, and then allow your natural and wise authority to express as a living
example of what you have learned. You are sought out for your advice and blessings, and when you
give your stamp of approval, or not, your word is respected.

It is also important that you have time alone. The theme of bonds made and broken is not personal.
You are not leaving the other person, but simply returning to your own self-absorbed 3rd line process
until life engages you again. Sometimes breaking a bond is appropriately permanent, but most of the
time breaking a bond simply means going for a drive or to a movie by yourself, and then returning
home for a meal with the family. Or breaking a bond in order to come together again, sooner or later,
to re-establish that bond on a stronger, more authentic level.

Interpersonal: Relationships that do not work out, especially early on, can be very painful for the
3/6 profile, and may keep them from forming intimate bonds for many years. Knowing how to make
correct decisions early in life, will help make them ready for the world. Martyr Role Models have a
deep capacity to sustain themselves and not give up, eventually leading them to objectivity. They find
that the ‘bad’ experiences are really the most important ones that they have had. Society conditions
us to believe that ‘mistakes’ are wrong. If 3rd lines are not encouraged and educated about their
process, the ‘bad’ mistakes pile up and they feel beaten down, develop an inferiority complex, and
carry a great weight of pessimism and shame. They may give up and walk away rather than use the
experience as guidance. 3rd lines are, after all, the ones with the greatest ability to uncover the truth
by discovering what does not work. Some of the most important discoveries in our world have come
through trial and error. To be a 3rd line is to be fully engaged in the wonder of life.

Martyr Role Models are both anarchists, and administrators who can happily recommend a cause
even if they would rather not be personally involved. If 6th lines understand the tripartite life
process, and live it authentically through their own Authority, a penetrating optimistic perspective
will emerge in later years in the form of experiential wisdom. They will step forward as a Role
Model, guided by their discoveries, and show us the perfection possible in the 9-centered life with
its flowering of potential and truths after the age of 50. This is a new pattern of maturation that is
being modeled, an unfolding process which cannot and should not be rushed.

Background: The Opportunist Role Model has the potential to be an important and influential
representative of what it means to live a 9-centered life. Completing the Personal Destiny process
begun by the 1/3 profile, 4/6’s externalize their foundation, and model through self-awareness what
it means to live uniquely as ‘yourself.’ This is an unusual profile as both lines are transpersonal,
however, its role is still one of personal destiny and remains self-absorbed in its life. The 4th line
consciously develops and employs its social gifts and personal networks to enhance its realm of
influence, but the unconscious 6th line rarely allows itself to become intimately involved as it must
remain separate and unencumbered in order to look at what lies ahead.

At the unconscious level, the 4/6 profile lives its life in three stages, and the first 30 years can
be a challenging time as the 6th line lives as a 3rd line and continually bumps into life in a very
subjective way. During this time, there is an internal discomfort because the conscious 4th line
wants stability and a solid foundation, while the unconscious 3rd line must go through its trial and
error, experimentation and discovery process. The unconscious 3rd line learns by exploring, in a
deep way, the truth of what ‘this’ material plane is. When the 2nd stage of life begins at age 30, the
Opportunist Role Model, now on the roof, enjoys a welcome reprieve in which to take the subjective
experiences and turn them into objective wisdom. With a bird’s eye view, it now sees that ‘this’ may
actually be ‘that.’ While up on the roof, the 4th line establishes its stability by engaging itself in
securing a family, a career, and a trusted network of friends. In the final stage that starts at age 50,
the 4/6 comes off the roof and re-engages in life, influencing and externalizing a new transcendent
perspective that is neither this nor that. Through the simple process of living life, they model what it
is to be uniquely yourself, rather than be defined by the nature of the world around you.

Personal: ‘There is a natural internal tension between your conscious yearning for connection and
quality relationships, and your unconscious desire to stand apart so you can objectively evaluate
and judge what life is really about and where we are heading. You are generally the cautious voyeur,
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE | 275

standing at the edge of the group, and watching with objective transpersonal eyes that are waiting
for the opportunity to contribute a new perspective and change the other’s way of thinking. Built
into your 4th line is the ability, with the right opportunity, to communicate your truth to the other.
You are not, however, interested in being changed by others. When you feel resistance from others,
you will abdicate and look for those that are receptive to what you have to share. Time spent alone
is refreshing and important for you as your interactions can result in people fatigue. Living through
your Strategy and Authority brings you those relationships that will ultimately allow you to influence,
externalize and model who you uniquely are. You are watching for relationships you can trust so that
you can truly become a living example of a leader without followers.

You have a genuine ability to develop intimate relationships, which also takes time and an investment
of your energy. It is also natural for you to observe and evaluate people from a distance. Every single
relationship matters as these are your friends who you will influence on a very deep level, and who
will provide you over time with the opportunities you need in life to model your new perspective.
You are not designed to influence strangers; you need those who are familiar with you, and they
need to be correct for you in all ways, not just because you see the potential for influence and
externalization. It may be years into a relationship before an actual opportunity presents itself, and
the energy invested must be simply for the relationship itself. In the wrong relationships, you will
be investing your energy without receiving energy back, and may abdicate the truth of who you are,
meet the wrong opportunities, and experience disappointment, sadness and fatigue.

Interpersonal: To properly raise 4th line children, we need to give them time to mature from
dependents to benefactors; they should not be rushed out into the world. 4th lines can be dependent
for a long time, but once they come into their own they make an important shift. Recognizing how
important it was to have a benefactor themselves, with their characteristic loyalty, they will in turn
take care of those who took care of them. Many 4th lines will become philanthropists, benefactors
to society as a whole, and create foundations that open up opportunities for others.

Relationships are everything for 4th lines; the quality of their lives is in direct proportion to the
quality of their networks. 4/6’s operate as a 3rd line, however, during the first stage of life, and they
can be bumped into by relationships and networks that do not work. The most valuable guidance
that a parent can offer during the first 30 years of a 4/6’s life concerns the relationships that they
enter into, as these can determine the success or failure of the flowering into a transcendent Role
Model that will take place after the age of 50.

At times, 4/6’s can be a fence-sitters as the 4th line wants involvement, and the 6th line simply wants
to watch. We need them to come down off the fence, however, and share their astute observations
with us. The Opportunist Role Model has a generous spirit that wants the best for everyone, and
they are able to bring love into the world with their warm hearts and wise heads. When their trust
is broken, however, their sensitive hearts can be easily wounded, and the warm heart can turn cold
and even mean when it is rejected.

Background: The Opportunist Investigator represents an interesting juxtaposition of the socially
open and friendly 4th line, and the unconscious, introverted and insecure 1st line. The 1st line is the
foundation of the lower trigram, and the 4th line is the foundation of the upper trigram, creating a
harmony of purpose. This is a unique profile that comprises only about 2% of the world’s population,
and with its Fixed Fate, serves as the bridge between the Right Angle Personal Destiny and Left
Angle Trans-Personal Karma. Neither this nor that, not personal or transpersonal, there is only one
Juxtaposition profile for each Hexagram. The 4/1 moves along its own specific line of geometry; like
a train on a track it has a movement and direction through life that cannot be altered.

Personal: You are designed to study, learn and establish a solid foundation in an area of life that
fascinates you, and then to influence others with your knowledge base. Your foundation is whatever
thing you love to immerse yourself in, and want to share with others. Investigating and becoming
an expert on a given topic transforms your inherent insecurity into an authority. Once you are
established as an authority, you can then go out to your network and become an influential expert
in your field. With your 4th line people skills, you have a natural ability to know how to best
communicate your knowledge base to others.

Your role is to network and bring together the research and development of the Personal Destiny
profiles with the marketing and universalizing of the Trans-Personal Karma profiles. You have one
foot in each world, yet you operate differently with a role that is separate and apart from them. For
you, Fixed Fate is a life of following your own unique line of geometry, whatever that may be. To
learn more about what your Fixed Fate is here to investigate and externalize, look at your Personality
Sun and Earth located in your BodyGraph. This will give you a sense of your purpose, of what you
are here to do in life. As you begin to live your life through your Strategy and as your own Authority,
you will witness your life aligning perfectly to your purpose, and to your fate.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 277

For all 4th lines, the quality of your life is deeply dependent upon the quality of your network
(family, friends and co-workers). Your opportunities to externalize your foundation come through
the people in your network, through friendly associations as you are not designed to influence
strangers. To effectively externalize your knowledge base, a personal connection is necessary. If you
are asked to speak at an event by someone you know, for example, it is best for you to show up early
and make as many face-to-face connections with the audience as possible. Or have a ‘get to know
you’ mixer the night before so that you will be speaking to a familiar and receptive room. It is also
important for you to have a solid foundation for your life in the areas of home, finances, relationships
and work. Achieving this in an ever-changing world, however, can be challenging.

Even though a 4/1 is fixed and solid like an oak tree, there is vulnerability inherent in this profile.
You are so fixed that you can be broken, and the pieces can be hard to put back together again.
Understanding how you are designed, and what your purpose is, can help you to stay on track and
deal with the challenges of life. In order to stay steady on your course and enjoy the tide, it is most
important that you be exactly who you are, and not change for anyone else. For you to maintain a
sense of balance and health, others will need to adapt to you as you cannot adapt to them. You can
go along with the other temporarily, but you must always return to your fixed unique way.

Interpersonal: Life and people are a real education for Opportunist Investigators, as they learn
through interaction that not everyone sees the world as black and white, or right and wrong, like they
do. They get a rude awakening into the ways of the world, which makes them somewhat vulnerable
and prone to heartache. 4/' 1’s learn through these experiences, however, and their Fixed Fate keeps
them moving forward. It is important to stay above the fray, and in addition to their broader network,
they need a trusted circle of close friends and confidants who provide unconditional loving support
without resistance. Opportunist Investigators enjoy the study of human behavior, and may enjoy
investigating some form of psychology, sociology, astrology or Human Design.

In order to get a good start in life, education and a solid secure home life are very important for a
4/1 child. They need to be encouraged and provided with the opportunity to study what they love
and enjoy. For relationships to work for a 4/1, they must be built on a foundation of friendship and
integrity as the bonding strategy is Brotherhood/Sisterhood or friends first, and then intimacy. The
‘other’ who is in a relationship with the Opportunist Investigator will need to do the adapting. 4/1’s
can be the most loyal and generous of friends, but they cannot be in relationships where they are
resisted, or where there is a lack of trust or loyalty. It is best to be completely honest and transparent
with 4/1 profiles because built into the 4th line is the abdicator. If they are resisted, they will move
on to find someone else who wants what they have.

If you argue with 4/1 profile, they will politely nod their head, while steadfastly and quietly holding
on to their own truth deep inside. It is very difficult to change the mind of a 4/1, however, it can be
done if you substantiate your points with good solid facts.

Background: In the ’Ching, the exalted or ruling 5th line embodies the theme of a hexagram.
For the Heretic Investigator, the unconscious 1st line, representing the authoritative foundation, is
joined by the 5th line which consciously projects all that foundation could or should be. The result
is that the 5/1 is the most transpersonal, with the highest universalizing potential, of all 12 profiles.
‘This is the profile of saviors and generals, or of trickery and paranoia, and it is very seductive. Heretic
Investigators are projected upon to save or rescue others with a practical solution in a time of crisis.

Personal: Trans-Personal Destiny means that you are here to deal with karma, and you are designed
to have encounters with others that can be important and potentially mutative for both you and them.
If you can picture your life path as a grid with intersecting points that represent these encounters,
you can get a sense of how you are destined to meet allies in life who are here to assist you, as well as
receive assistance from you. These karmic encounters, which very often can feel like déja vu, can be as
complex as a business arrangement or as simple as someone asking you for directions. You are aware
on some level of your conscious transpersonal Sth line, an alluring and seductive line that is continually
projected upon. Others feel, without even knowing you, that you have something potentially important
and helpful that they need. This projection draws people to you, providing you with the ability to have
the encounters in life that you need in order to live out your unique life purpose.

Others project onto you that you can lead, guide, help or save them, and when it’s the right
projection, you enjoy filling the role, and being able to deliver practical solutions with your expert
problem solving skills. There are times, however, when the projection you are feeling is not the
right one for you, and you feel insecure and unsure that you can provide what the other person
needs and wants. It is important for you to know which projections are the correct ones to say
yes to. If you say yes when it is not correct, you can get caught in the illusory web created by
the projections of others, and make commitments you cannot live up to resulting in a tarnished
reputation. It is healthy for you to be suspicious and a bit paranoid of the expectations of others.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 279

Ra has said, “The hopes and dreams of humanity rest on the shoulders of a 5th line.” This is a
big responsibility to carry, and the best way to operate within this expectant projection field is to
stand on a solid, practical and authentic foundation.

One of the advantages of being a 5th line is that the initial projection from others starts out as
positive. People are projecting onto you that you can deliver what they need, and if you deliver
something practical, your reputation will flourish. If a practical solution is not provided, if what
you have given them is a ‘house of cards’, your reputation suffers and the ‘heretic will be burned
at the stake.’ Without a reputation that can be trusted, your conscious 5th line may have to
change direction and begin again somewhere else. You need to make sure that, before you get
involved, you are prepared with a practical solution that works for everyone. You do this with your
unconscious 1st line, the Investigator. Your 1st line is designed to get to the bottom of things, to
study and establish a secure foundation of knowledge. Once you have a solid foundation, and have
become an authority, you are prepared to impact and mutate society, when needed. Following your
Strategy and Authority will guide you to the right circumstance and timing for universalizing
your practical foundation.

You are a keen observer of the world around you, and preparedness, as well as correct timing, is
essential to your success. When the two come together, you are the Heretic Investigator who can
break through humanity’s habit of seeing things in the same old way, and make your revolutionary
heretical point of view work when all else has failed. Unlike 4th lines, whose greatest influence is
within their networks and personal associations, you are most powerful as a stranger of consequence.
You are designed to interface with new people who are ready to receive your heretical mutative
information; familiarity breeds contempt for a 5th line. You greatly benefit from times of withdrawal,
out of the projection field, to build up strength and cultivate your skills so that you can be ready to
meet the next crisis when the commitment is correct for you. You find refreshment on many levels
through cultivating beauty and creativity.

Interpersonal: Heretic Investigators aspire to make themselves personally attractive in order to
improve their chances of universalizing, as well as to seduce a partner into seducing them. They
have vulnerabilities and insecurities, and are reluctant to show their true self. Few people ever truly
know the 5th line as they are shrouded in an elusive projection field. The 5th line hoards, or holds
back, and waits for the illusion of power (the projection field) to build, and the right moment to
universalize the foundation. Providing practical solutions in crisis situations requires disciplined
patience. Heretic Investigators thrive on this process, but need to remember to return to their
waiting once they have satisfied a projection, in order to prepare for the next. They must be able to
recognize when it is the right time to move on, or else sufter damage to their reputation. If they wait
too long to leave and there is nothing left to save, new layers of projections get added over the first
ones that may not be correct for them. In addition, the 5/1 profile has an interesting connection
with the 6/2 profile. Because of the wisdom and trust associated with 6/2’s, they can enhance or save
the reputations of 5/1’s by innocently supporting their heresy, and the practical foundation they are
universalizing. The reverse is also true. 6/2’s can destroy their reputation as well.

Background: Living within a dual projection field, Heretic Hermits must be their own stimulus or
motivation. When the correct projection sets things in motion, the Heretic calls it’s own Hermit’s
gifts forth, applying or universalizing what it does naturally. 5/2’s live an unusual life of constant
projection. Returning to the house metaphor, we have the conscious 5th line on the second floor,
behind the curtain and looking out on the street, very aware of the people below projecting up at
it as they wonder what is going on behind that curtain. The unconscious 2nd line is on the first
floor, lights on, curtains open, dancing around, unaware that people are looking in and projecting
onto it as well.

‘This rare profile is referred to as the reluctant Heretic, as it is quite commonplace for Heretic
Hermits to remain detached and uninvolved due to the uncertainty of whether they can deliver on
the projection from others. Although they are a transpersonal profile, unlike 5/1’s that have karma
with the other, 5/2’s carry their own karma within. They have to live out something based on what
they lived out in the past, but ‘they’ are the ones that have to discover it. If they don’t, whatever it is
does not get called out, and they do not get to universalize it.

Personal: You are deeply gifted in an unusual way, and itis very important for you to understand how
to engage with life. What you are waiting for is the correct internal call to something revolutionary,
something you can lead others to that lies beyond the mundane plane. Once properly engaged,
you are empowered to selflessly nourish those you are here to support, while providing for your
own material needs at the same time. Unlike 5/1’s who universalize a foundation, something they
have investigated and studied, you are universalizing your own natural talents and gifts. This is
personal and you can feel very vulnerable. When you are called to step in and help, you are asking
people to believe in you. You have to stand on your charismatic power alone, and this can create
much uncertainty.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 281

Your 2nd line genius is unconscious and buried deep inside you, and it is difficult for you to know
when you have received the correct call. You are called through the projection field, and it is
imperative to your success and reputation that you understand how to make correct decisions by
using your Strategy and Authority. Only when you have recognized the correct call can you fulfill
the projection. The 5th line in your profile starts with a positive projection from others that you can
deliver what they need and want, and the moment you don't fulfill that projection your reputation
suffers. This is a transpersonal profile, and your reputation can suffer on a wide scale, therefore it is
even more important for you to understand how to make correct decisions from your own authority
and not the projection field. It is a necessity for you, and also a relief, to get away from the projections
of others, as you feel naturally and comfortably complete, and are happy to be alone with yourself.
Your 2nd line unconscious body needs its special hermit alone time to stay healthy, and to nurture
your natural gifts and talents.

Asa Hermit, you have no inherent interest in improving what you do naturally, or proving to yourself
or others what you hold to be true. And as a Heretic, you are not comfortable being projected upon
by just any person in crisis to provide practical solutions, or to fulfill hopes and expectations. If
you experience many failures in living up to others’ projections, this can negatively reinforce your
tendency for aloneness. You can feel uncertain about what you actually can do, and get overwhelmed
and confused by so many projections. If pushed to an unhealthy extreme, you may choose to insulate
yourself from all outside expectations, and then endure the reputation of an underachiever or hoarder
who refuses to empower and universalize your gifts for the benefit of others.

Interpersonal: The secret to interacting with Heretic Hermits is to avoid pressuring them in any way.
Wait until they call themselves out, and see their own way into a predicament or crisis that requires
their particular and inherent genius. This is how this unusual profile manifests evolutionary new
truths in the world in personally rewarding ways, and maintains harmony for itself, as 5/2’s believe
that the root of harmony is that no one should be pressured. In relationships, the 5th line Heretic
relies on its power of attraction to get the other's attention, while the Hermit’s shyness automatically
sets up a protective barrier to real intimacy. When a pursuer or person of interest appears, however,
this profile can let down its barrier, thus permitting the pursuer’s boldness to effectively complete
the seduction and open the way to intimacy.

The 5/2 child’s need to motivate itself can be frustrating and challenging for parents. There is
tremendous expectation placed on these children to show their talent or genius in the world, and
to help others. When they retreat into their room instead to seemingly play around, their families
can project on them that they are underachievers. This can make 5/2 children very uncomfortable
with others as they always feel the pressure of those projected expectations. They can also be very
suspicious of what others see in them, as they are insecure about their natural talents and not sure
if they can meet the projection. In working with 5/2 children it is best to present many different
things to them until something turns them on. They are very selective, but once turned on they will
call themselves out and share their natural abilities.

Background: The transpersonal Role Model Hermit is here to show us all how to live authentically
without being dependent on outside authorities, and to realize and accept our unique perfection. The
unconscious and naturally gifted Hermit just wants to be left alone to do its own thing. In the house
metaphor, Line 6 sits on the roof, separate from the rest of the house, but with a view into the next
house, or the next hexagram. Role Models are not necessarily interested in what is going on inside the
house; they are more interested in the broader view.

‘This rooftop perch gives 6/2’s the ability to be removed from the ‘drama’ of life, and allows them to
objectively observe and offer a detached viewpoint, much like the sage on the mountaintop. The 2nd
and 6th lines have something in common as the Hermit's natural gifts are always noticed, and the Role
Model observer is also always being observed.

Personal: You can feel a bit out of syne with the world. You have a birds’ eye view of life, so you can
see the big picture and are wise beyond your years. Profiles without a 6th line do not have the ability
to see life the way you see it, and this can make you feel disconnected from others, or question and
wonder why they don't they see what is obvious to you. When combined, your 6th and 2nd lines give
you the capacity to be the democratic administrator; a unique, capable and wise authority.

As with all 6th lines, you will go through three significant stages in life. It is important for you to
embrace each aspect of this process as it matures and prepares you for your true calling, which is the
role of trusted leader. The first 30 years are trial and error discovery, gathering valuable experiences,
and losing some of your innocence as you get exposed to the hard realities of life, and what does not
work. The second stage of your development is a time for you to retreat, heal your wounds, regain your
optimism, enjoy life and watch for the things that do work. Your unconscious 2nd line Hermit feels
good in this stage as withdrawal is natural. After the age of 50, you receive a calling, re-engage with life,
and become a true Role Model and living example of the wise, aware, objective judge and observer.
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE __ 283

You are always noticed, and have great transpersonal power even when you are withdrawn and reclusive.
A life of harmony for you means no agendas or pressure to prove yourself. Your ability to stay above
the fray, removed from the insignificant dramas in life, helps you to maintain objectivity. You are most
interested in things with depth and meaning; the trivial does not engage you. Others see you as an
objective administrator, and will call you out for advice. As a transpersonal person, you are someone
others listen to and your advice carries a lot of weight. If you say this thing works or not, or this
person is good or bad, people will take your word for it. Your 6th line, when healthy, is fundamentally
optimistic — hoping and dreaming for the best in life for everyone, including yourself. At the same
time, your unconscious 2nd line sees the frailties and self-hatred that exists within humanity.

Your natural genius and innate talents must be protected and allowed to unfold naturally in order
to be called out and made available to the world. You are not a generalist, and there is a specific and
special call that will allow you to bring out your gifts and embody your Role Model power. This
calling is not something that you will find by seeking; it must be called out of you by others. There
is a noble, self-sufficient, optimistic and visionary quality that emerges from you if you are able to
stay with your process, maintain your perspective, and safeguard your natural gifts during the first
two stages of life. Your unconscious uncertainty, however, can cause you to hold back and not share
your special gifts with the world. Your Strategy and Authority will guide you to the correct people
and the correct call.

Interpersonal: Role Model Hermits are idealists looking for the perfect life and perfect mate;
someone they can stand with, relate to, and be proud of. The potential partner must be bold, however,
and break through the 6/2 barrier. During the first 30-year trial and error cycle they jump into
intimacy only to suffer from disillusionment and disappointment. Typically, meeting their mate is
possible only after they enter the retreat phase of life, and yet, a lot of time can be spent in this phase
trying to change a partner into the perfect model. It is important that 6/2’ live their truth, and not
attempt to change the truth of others. Trust is nourishing for the Role Model Hermit, and they
cannot be intimate with anyone they cannot trust. If the trust is broken, you will only get access to
the 6/2 on a superficial level.

It is very important to support the 6/2 child in discovering their true nature, and to not shame
them for any trial and error ‘mistakes’ that are made in the first 30 years. They can be insecure in
their gifts, and can be their own worse critics, as they are always looking for perfection. They need
encouragement to explore and try things. When something does not work out, a parent can guide
the child to learn from the discovery by asking “What did you learn from this experience?”

The 3-part 6th line developmental process is something all human beings go through, and is
modeled and accentuated by 6th lines as they lead us through this transition to the new 9-centered
form. They are here to show us the way to live as a differentiated 9-centered being, able to operate
and make decisions from our own authority. Role Model Hermits are here to show us how to live
according to our own wisdom.

Background: The Role Model Martyr, the completion point of the 12 profiles, combines the
conscious and aloof 6th line which seeks the perfection in life, with the unconscious, restless,
materially-oriented and mutative 3rd line. The 6/3 is a profile of transition and change, which can
lead to a potentially chaotic and destabilizing life. No matter where the 6th line is in the tripartite
life process, the unconscious 3rd line continually pulls it into subjective experiences. It is through this
process though that 6/3’s become the wisest of Role Models, ultimately discovering that uniqueness
is perfection, and that we cannot trust in anyone when making decisions but ourselves.

Personal: As is true for all 6th lines, you will go through a three-part life process. For a 6/3 profile these
three stages are experienced differently as the first 30 years are experienced as a 3/3 profile, which is
a doubly intense and sometimes very difficult trial and error process. You are gathering subjective
experiences, and you engage in and try just about everything, including jumping into situations and
relationships that do not work. You can become disappointed, and ultimately conditioned, to feel
pessimistically that nothing in life really works.

It is not necessary that you go through a traumatic first stage, and how you experience this first
phase is dependent upon the parenting and conditioning that you receive as a child. If you are raised
as yourself, respected as an individual and given guidance on how to make decisions as yourself,
you will have a smoother first stage. If you are your own Authority, you will gain wisdom from
these subjective experiences and discover what is correct for you to discover. 6/3 children need
to be encouraged and taught to see that a trial and error process is not about mistakes, but rather
opportunities for learning. Otherwise you can end up with both a martyr and inferiority complex,
along with a chip on your shoulder and a deep pessimism about life.

Between 30 and 50 you go up onto the roof for a more aloof, objective observation process. This is
the time when you retreat from the subjective experiences as your 3/3 is now a 6/3, but you don’t
really get the reprieve of staying securely up on the roof that a 6/2 profile does. Your unconscious
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 285

3rd line continually pulls on you to engage again and again in the experiential trial and error process,
with feelings of “this is not it, there is still more,” and “there are still things to try and things that still
need to be explored.” You move up and down the ladder between being connected and being aloof,
between sympathy and apathy. If burned by an unpleasant or discouraging experience you retreat for
awhile, until you are bored or a new adventure looks appealing, and then you climb down again and
engage in the next experience. You are driven by your conscious 6th line’s optimism that all things
are possible, and that you can find something to trust and a soul mate. You move back and forth
between pessimism and optimism.

From 50 years on, you experience the potential for the fulfillment of your uniqueness and your
flowering into a Role Model. By this time in your life, if you have survived, you have gained a
tremendous amount of wisdom and will be looked to as a wise and objective advisor with a unique
perspective on life. Lurking at the unconscious level though is your 3rd line, ready for the next
discovery, the next experiment that may disrupt the tranquility and perfection the 6th line would
like to enjoy. Objectivity is your saving grace; it sustains you. It is what you aspire to and what brings
you harmony in your life. Yours is a life of constant transition, of engagement and disengagement.
Having a partner in life is important for you, and it is correct for you to have a life of bonds made
and broken, to be able to pull away and then re-engage again. When you are operating as your own
unique authority, you experience the transitions that are correct for you. There is nothing worse for
you than a mental decision that goes bad, and it can lead to painful and damaging experiences.

Interpersonal: Role Model Martyrs are born with resilience, and an ability to sustain their own
direction. Life works for them when they can embrace the chaos and confusion and wonderment
of their early years, and receive all as essential discovery and learning as this is the foundation for
their valuable wisdom. The 6/3 profile needs supportive relationships with people they trust, people
who provide the option to pull away or break the bond when necessary in order to reconnect and
strengthen it.

6th lines model for us the new way to live in this 9-centered world. The old ways were based on
leaders and followers, with 5th line universalizers conditioning us into homogenized humans who
continually gave their Authority to others. Human Design came into the world to liberate the
individual, and to nurture the uniqueness of all human beings. The essence of this is embodied and
demonstrated in the 6th line theme. As we enter into a new era of mutation, getting closer and
closer to 2027 and a 6th line way of being in the world, the structures and institutions that support
giving our Authority over to outside influences will continue to crumble.

In the old 7-centered model, we were told what to do. It’s not in the nature of a 6th line to do this;
instead they innocently model what it means to live our lives correctly as ourselves, through our own
Authority. They walk among us in their post Kiron phase as examples of 9-centered living, allowing
the uniqueness to unfold. 6th lines demonstrate that it is ok to be yourself, and that you can find
what you need within.

SECTION EIGHT
THE GLOBAL INCARNATION CROSS INDEX

OUR TRUE PURPOSE

Ra was hesitant to release the Global Incarnation Cross information before The Human Design
System had sound footing in the world because he knew that people would have a tendency to
interpret their cross either as something they were entitled to, or as something that was inevitable,
regardless of how they lived their lives. This is simply not the case.

Our Incarnation Cross isn’t something that automatically emerges as we go through our de-
conditioning process, nor does it provide instant gratification; it’s much more than that. When
we function as our differentiated self in the world, our cross literally but quite naturally takes over
our life. Fulfilling our purpose takes a lifetime of patient and disciplined attention to making
decisions that are correct for us, combined with a dedication to fine-tuning our own awareness.
We don't awaken to our cross, we awaken in it. Our cross embodies the full expression of our
awareness potential and our process of living awake.

Each human being is an aspect of the totality, with a unique contribution to make as an interactive
part of that whole. Our life’s activity is expressed as our purpose and is captured in our Incarnation
Cross by combining the themes of the Sun and Earth positions in both columns of the Human
Design Chart. In the Mandala on the opposite page is an example of an Incarnation Cross with
the Personality Sun in Gate 1 and Personality Earth in Gate 2, and Design Sun in Gate 7 and
Design Earth in Gate 13. Each of us carries our own cross in life and all crosses are essential to
the whole; no single cross is more important than any other.

There are 192 basic Incarnation Crosses and 768 specific Incarnation Crosses used in analy:
a very brief summary of each of the 192 basic Incarnation Crosses, expressed in very general
terms to keynote the potential of living a life with awareness, follows this introduction. A full
Incarnation Cross reading is needed to understand a cross completely. (Full Incarnation Cross
Readings are available from an IHDS Certified Professional Analyst.)

THE FOUR QUARTERS

“THE WITNESS RETURNS THROUGH THE WOMB, TO BUILD AND BOND, MAKE MORE,
MEASURE AND DIE.” — RA URU HU

‘The four gates of the Right Angle Cross of the Sphinx (on the next page) divide the Mandala
into four Quarters: Initiation (Gate 13), Civilization (Gate 2), Duality (Gate 7) and Mutation
(Gate 1). Understanding the distinctly different themes of the four Quarters expands the
meaning of our cross. Combining the keynotes of the four Quarters into one descriptive
sentence we could say that we are here to Initiate (begin) Civilization (build) through Duality
(bonding) and Mutate (or evolve) until we die.
SECTION EIGHT: THE GLOBAL INCARNATION CROSS INDEX, OUR TRUE PURPOSE 289

How TO FIND YOUR INCARNATION CROSS

‘The illustration below demonstrates how to determine which Quarter your Incarnation Cross is
located in. To find the description of your Quarter and Cross, please look for your Personality Sun
Gate on your chart, and then look for the Personality Sun symbol (Q) and the corresponding gate
number and quarter for your Incarnation Cross in the Mandala below. The following four pages
describe the theme for each quarter, and list the page numbers where you will find your cross. You
will also find the name of your Incarnation Cross on your Human Design Chart printout.

In the First Quarter the witness (the Personality crystal) returns to earth, once again bringing
renewal to the evolution of consciousness on the mental plane. This is where purpose is fulfilled
through Mind, through thinking, educating, conceptualizing, explaining and sharing what it
means to be alive in a Form. It sets in motion the fine tuning of our mind as we learn to surrender
to the directives of our form. Once our mind is comfortable in our form, we no longer yearn to
live life as anyone but ourselves. Notice that all but one of the seven gates of the Solar Plexus,
the center of relational intelligence and emerging spirit awareness, are clustered in the Quarter
of Initiation. Notice that the Channel of Initiation is located here. The crosses for the Quarter of
Initiation are shown on pages 294-297.
SECTION EIGHT: THE GLOBAL INCARNATION CROSS INDEX, OUR TRUE PURPOSE 291

The Second Quarter is focused on the form's journey through life, and what is needed to manifest
support for humanity after birth. This is where the mind’s carefully initiated (formulated) concepts
are concretized into form. This dominantly yang quarter is responsible for building the structures
and communities and civilizations that support the form so everyone can develop and thrive. It
anticipates industrialization, territoriality, material progress, the differentiation and perfecting
of individual skills to benefit the whole, and the essential role or position of women in creating
a civilizing, creative and safe environment for children/everyone. Notice that all 11 gates of the
‘Throat Center fall into this Quarter of Civilization: the sharing, supporting and empowering
of the full scope of humanity's potential to express its intelligence. Purpose is fulfilled through
manifesting, through the movement of spirit into form. The crosses for the Quarter of Civilization
are shown on pages 298-301.
292 __ THE DEFINITIVE Book OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘The Third Quarter brings us to the most mundane and intimately human of the four, where we
cross the barrier of our separateness and address our need for the other, and mystically the two
becomes the one. In this realm we penetrate to the core of the dual nature of our existence; on
the one hand expanding the Maya (Measure for Measure) while on the other connecting to the
beauty and mysteries of incarnating. It makes our ability to bond with others a constant source of
wonder. Purpose here is fulfilled through bonding; through the genetic imperative to reproduce
and replicate the species by choosing the best mate, thus ensuring humanity’s future. The Quarter
of Duality takes us from Mind (conceptualizing) and Form (building) to bonding (the mysteries of
co-creation). Notice that the Channel of Discovery and Mating, plus all seven gates of the Spleen,
with its survival intelligence, are located here. The crosses for the Quarter of Duality are shown on
pages 302-305.
SECTION EIGHT: THE GLOBAL INCARNATION CROSS INDEX, OUR TRUE PURPOSE 293

In this Fourth Quarter, the cycle of an authentic and transformed life is brought to completion, to
a satisfying, peaceful, successful or surprisingly delightful end. At the same time, preparations are
made for new beginnings anticipating future incarnations at the next level of consciousness. What
has been learned and manifested as a fully-lived life is carefully assessed, scrutinized for meaning and
pruned; what survives is carried forward and made ready to be passed on as truths, foundations for
the next generation. In the Quarter of Mutation, purpose is fulfilled by attaining your full potential
for transformation and awareness. The mystical theme, accepting death, is a matter of surrendering
to what life is with an understanding that, when you have accomplished your purpose it is time to
move on. There is comfort in knowing that if you live correctly you will die correctly. Notice that the
Channel of Exploration, and much of the Sacral’s responsive, generative energy, as well as the Root’s
pressure that is our momentum for living, manifest through this Quarter of Mutation. The crosses for
the Quarter of Mutation are shown on pages 306-309.

HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE

Certified Professional Analysts are trained to interpret a Human Design BodyGraph. The
combined perspectives of the true self, who you are designed to be, and the not-self, where you
are open to taking in conditioning from the outside world, form the foundation for understanding
your design. Ra Uru Hu was a master synthesizer who created a language he termed Keynotes; a
living, symbolic language that allows analysts to express the genetic continuity contained within
‘The Science of Differentiation’s complex and revolutionary perspectives. Keynotes compress a great
deal of information into a single word or phrase. Like a mantra, keynotes invoke or awaken or
connect us with our body’s chemistry, with our own unique frequency. Learning and using the
language of keynotes is like thinking with the body’s hormonal messaging system; it allows us to
connect energetically with others. Almost every aspect of The Human Design System has its own
keynote associated with it. By stringing the keynotes of one’s definition and open centers together,
professional analysts create a word picture or story of a person’s character and purpose. As the
keynotes are delivered, the story penetrates the person on a cellular level that is beyond the mind.

Keynotes have been used throughout this book to explain The Human Design System. A complete
listing of the gate and channel keynotes used in Human Design can be found in Section Eleven.
Sample chart overviews for each of the Types follow, and will provide you with a superficial example
of keynoting, and the synthesis that takes place when an analyst works with your chart. The basis of
an in-depth reading, by a professionally trained analyst, is the weaving of your genetic information
with practical tools for living your unique life.

“HUMAN DESIGN IS NOTHING BUT KEYNOTES. KEYNOTES ARE IN SOME WAYS LIKE HAIKU.
THEY ARE VERY, VERY SPECIFIC FORMULAS AND AS SUCH, IN SO MANY WAYS, THEY’RE
GENERALIZATIONS, SO ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO
CAN QUOTE THE INFORMATION, BUT THAT’S NOT THE POINT. WE ARE A HOLISTIC ILLUSION,
IF | CAN PUT IT THAT WAY. WE ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR FORMULAS. AND WE HAVE
FORMULAS THAT INDICATE WHAT WE ARE, AND WE HAVE FORMULAS THAT INDICATE WHAT
THE NOT-SELF IS. WE HAVE KEYNOTES FOR EVERYTHING. BUT TO BE ABLE TO USE KEYNOTES
IS NOT SCIENCE; IT’S ART. AND IT TAKES PRACTICE AND IT TAKES TIME, BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT
THE FREEDOM THAT COMES IN THE ANALYSIS OF A BODYGRAPH, THE FREEDOM THAT HAS TO
BE THERE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT IT AND EXPLORES IT.

THE KEYNOTES ARE A SYNTHESIS. EACH KEYNOTE IS A SYNTHESIS OF THE VALUE OF THAT
PARTICULAR ASPECT. WHEN YOU LAY THEM OUT IN ANY KIND OF GEOMETRY, YOU TRULY OPEN
UP THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REALLY READ YOUR FORMULA, SEE YOUR FORMULA
AND TO EXPAND UPON IT. KEYNOTING IS AN ADVENTURE. WHAT I LIKE IS THE EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE YOU DON’T REALLY KNOW UNTIL YOU START DOING IT. WHEN YOU START DOING
IT IT’S LIKE AN EMPTY CANVAS IN FRONT OF YOU AND WHAT YOU’RE ABOUT TO DO IS WRITE
YOUR CODE. THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, WHAT THAT ACTUALLY SAYS, WHAT
KIND OF A MOMENT THAT IS FOR YOU, AND WHAT KIND OF GRACE IT TAKES.” — RA URU HU

314 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Your gift in the world is your ability to act independently, to initiate action and to impact others.
When perceived as threatening or unpredictable, however, these same qualities can make others
uncomfortable, often leading them to try and control you or resist you in some way. As a Manifestor,
you can be at ease with solitude. You don’t really require outside assistance, and sometimes you
wonder why others would even care about what you do, much less want to resist or control you. Try
to control they do, though, from parents on up. An early and unpleasant history of conditioning
experiences, mixed with resistance, pushes you toward the not-self theme of Anger which is
expressed in one of two ways: as anger/rage and rebelliousness, or as passivity and accommodation.
Either expression causes you to repress your power, and keeps you from realizing your worth. This
is why your Strategy to Inform before you act is so important. It relaxes the resistance from others,
and opens the way for you to have what you seek most in life, namely the peace to do what you want
to do when you want to do it. You are a self-contained person, and at times you can see others as
rather alien. With your ability to look ahead and initiate, they can feel out of sync with your timing.

‘The concern that you have is “Will I be answered? Will someone be enlivened by my impact, or
respond to my initiating question?” This underlying pressure to impact, to make things happen, is
the key to fulfilling your purpose. Although you are most comfortable when left alone to do your
own thing, the other three Types are waiting for you to spark or initiate them so each can contribute
their essential part. And you often look to the other types to provide the specific energies needed to
complete what you dream. In a perfect world, Manifestors get things started, Projectors guide the
process, Generators provide the energy to bring it into form or complete it, and Reflectors tell us
how well the process is going, or not.

Your Strategy of informing may seem unnatural to you, and you probably resist informing others
because you don't want them to put up barriers or resist you. You are not designed to ask for permission,
and so you keep quiet and do what you want without informing, hoping that you will not meet with
resistance. This not-self strategy usually backfires, however, and you meet the resistance anyway and
often even more intensely, which creates a no-win vicious circle. When you do Inform before taking
action on a decision, others feel included and respected. They may not like what you are doing, but
knowing about it in advance eases the resistance and potential backlash. In addition, informing gives
you an opportunity to use the resistance field as a guide to right timing and action. If you announce
to an office of 50 people, for instance, that you are now shifting to a 4 day work week, and 47 of the
people are unhappy with this decision, you have an opportunity to adjust or refine your decision.

When you are making a decision, your Spleen is your Inner Authority, and it is very important that
you listen when it speaks to you. Splenic Authority speaks to you quietly in the moment, and does
not repeat itself. It’s ‘voice’ will feel more like an intuitive or instinctual recognition. If you miss its
signal, or ignore it, it does not warn you again. Your Spleen is here to keep you alive, safe and healthy.
It will only give you warnings about your survival in the moment, and as needed.

In fact, your Splenic Authority flows out of you naturally, moment by moment. Such spontaneity
may sound freeing, but it creates a dilemma where you may have to inform when you have only an
inkling of the impact that your immediate decision or action might have. It takes intention, concerted
effort, and living closely attuned to your Splenic Authority to be effective in your informing. For
example, if you step into a restaurant with friends, and your body stops you because something does
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 315

not feel right to it, you have no choice but to pay attention to it. It is alerting you that it is not healthy
for you to enter, and yet your Splenic warning does not come with an explanation. All you can do
is honestly inform your companions of what action is correct for you right now, with an awareness
of how your sudden decision impacts them and their plans. Overall, informing brings you greater
peace and this is what you desire more than anything - to have no resistance. When you are peaceful
it is a signpost that you have aligned yourself to your Authority, and it is from this place that you are
empowered to manifest and make your unique impact on the world.

Your Profile, the costume you wear in the world, is the 1/4, or Investigator Opportunist. Your profile
is the role you play in life so that your purpose can express itself, and you are here to investigate
things deeply. You are driven to establish secure foundations in your life, and consciously you can
be very introspective and self-absorbed. Your intention is to establish a level of authority yourself
that can be shared with others. At the same time there is an unconscious part of you that is very
influential, and has the ability to relate to others at a brotherhood/sisterhood level. Your community
is very important to you as you are designed unconsciously to establish relationships or friendships
that will bring you the opportunities you need to get your knowledge out, and influence others. In
any type of close or intimate relationship, however, it is important for you to establish a friendship
first. Strangers are not comfortable for you. By following your Strategy of informing and listening
to your Spleen’s Authority you will focus your energy on what is most important for you, as well
as connect to your correct networks. In this way you establish a personal and secure foundation,
establish your realm of influence, share your investigations with others, and maintain your health and
well-being. As an Investigator Opportunist, the study of people can be quite a fascination for you.

You have a split in your chart which means there are two separate areas in your design that are not
connected to each other. These two parts can take time to sync up, and you may feel very conditioned
that there is something missing in you that you need to be complete. One aspect of your split is
the Root Center connected to the Splenic Center and the Throat Center through the Channel of
Judgment, A design of Insatiability (58/18); the Channel of Struggle, A design of Stubbornness
(38/28); and the Channel of The Wavelength, A design of Talent (48/16). The other part of your
split is the Head Center connected to the Ajna Center by the Channel of Abstraction, A Design of
Mental Activity and Clarity (64-47).

‘The open gate that can bridge your Split Definition is Gate 62, the Gate of Detail. This puts a
tremendous amount of conditioning on you to find the detail that substantiates the opinion. You can
become obsessed with details, causing you to make mental decisions about which detail you ‘think is
the detail you need. In truth, as you go through your investigations, your Splenic awareness as your
Authority will guide you to the correct detail. When not listening to your Authority, you can chase
down endless details, leading to overwork, overwhelm and exhaustion.

You have four channels, or types of life force energy, defined in your design. This is the energy that
is consistent in you that you put out to others, and it forms the foundation for what you can trust in
your own life process. Let’s take a look at each one:

Channel of Judgment: A Design of Insatiability (58/18). This channel creates the insatiable drive to
challenge, correct and perfect for the betterment of the collective and society; and to find peace in
316 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

the perfected pattern. When you are operating as true self, if something isn't working in the greater
world around you, you have the logic to challenge it until it is corrected. When the perfecting or
critiquing process is made personal, however, and turned inward on you or those close to you, it can
result in constant fault finding, and a pervading dissatisfaction with life in general that can create
friction in relationships.

Channel of Struggle: A design of Stubbornness (38-28). There is nothing more satisfying for you
than to be correctly invited to stand up for something you feel is worth fighting for as this signifies
that your life has meaning. This is the fuel for your personal struggle to find a purpose that makes
living worthwhile, and through your example, each unique search for meaning prods, encourages and
empowers others in their own struggle for meaning. You can become very depressed, or depressing
for others, if you are unable to find a reason for living. It takes a long time though for you to give up
your search as you are designed with a stubbornness that allows you to persevere through struggles
that most others cannot. Your Spleen’s Authority will help you be aware of what struggles are correct
for you to enter into or not.

‘The pressure that you feel from your Root Center, through both of these channels, can become
excessive at times, and push you to step out of your Authority and struggle when you do not
need to. In order to maintain your physical health, when you feel restless, exercise is important.
Sometimes all that is needed to calm down and refocus yourself is a good walk around the block
to burn off the extra steam.

Channel of The Wavelength: A Design of Talent (48-16). You are here to master a skill through
repetition, or practice, while striving for perfection. A skill can be anything from playing an
instrument, to figuring out a scientific formula, to making your way in the world. When your
achievements are shared and become a part of the collective wavelength, you often serve a wider
purpose, or improve the lives of others in some way. If you can be disciplined to stay with the
repetitive process long enough, you will eventually be liberated from the learning technique and
your talent will just naturally flow from you.

Channel of Abstraction: A Design of Mental Activity and Clarity. (64/47). You have a very active,
experiential mind that never stops playing with possibilities, and you probably wonder if it will never
stop being busy. You can experience considerable mental confusion as a result of the constant swirl
of images always moving through it. This confusion, though, can mark the beginning of a new and
inspiring journey for you as you discover what really does make sense. If you remain patient with
your discovery process, the pieces of the puzzle will at some point come together and a picture will
appear. Your reward for being patient, for waiting for clarity to emerge over time, is the uncovering
of an inspiring tale to tell, or a new perspective to share with others. Your active mind is a wonderful
outer authority for others, however, is not a useful resource for you in terms of figuring out your own
life. Mental recognition for you will come over time, while your Authority through your Spleen is
here to guide your decision making in the moment.

‘The Undefined Centers that are open in your design are the G, Heart, Sacral and Solar Plexus. These
centers are places of deep conditioning and potential wisdom.
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 317

Your Undefined G Center conditions your not-self mind to obsess about identity, love and direction;
who am I, where is my love and what direction should I go next? When you let go of worrying about
these things and stop trying to find them, you discover who you are, love finds you, and your next
direction shows itself, all as a natural process of life.

Your Undefined Heart pushes you to try and prove your worth. This plays out in many ways. You
might try to prove yourself by constantly trying to improve yourself, or by overcompensating and
making promises. You are not designed to commit to or promise anything to anyone, and breaking a
promise can break your heart. Your life is not about willing yourself to do anything. You ‘do’in your
life through your Strategy of informing and your Authority of following your instincts. Once you
let go of trying to prove yourself, you can become wise about knowing who has an overblown ego,
who really can commit to things, and who really is of value to the community.

Your Undefined Sacral leads you to over-do, work too hard ,and often can be obsessed with sex.
You are designed to initiate an enterprise, but not to do it all or complete it yourself. It is very
easy for you to fall into the trap of doing too much which will lead to exhaustion and eventual ill
health. The wisdom available through an open sacral is knowing when enough is enough. Slowing
down, setting and keeping boundaries, and making decisions with your Authority are the key to
keeping you healthy.

Your Undefined Solar Plexus, when combined with the Undefined Sacral, can intensify any
obsession with sex and romance. The Solar Plexus Center carries feelings of desire, intimacy, and
passion, and when undefined these sensations can be amplified and powerful. In fact, the sometimes
overwhelming mix of the emotions that you take in from others through your open Solar Plexus can
also lead you to avoid the unpleasant sides of emotionality, even when it is important to confront
them. As a Manifestor with a not-self theme of Anger, this emotion can also get amplified in certain
circumstances. The potential wisdom of your undefined Solar Plexus is to learn to discern which
emotionally uncomfortable situations actually need to be dealt with.

In summary, you are designed to serve others by being an initiating force in the world. When you
stay alert to your intuitive knowing you spark others to think about the values of society, and their
own individual struggle as it relates to survival, values and purpose. You have a sharp eye for critical
detail. Through the synthesis of your investigative interest in people, your love of life, the lessons you
have learned from the past, and the networks of allies that you cultivate, you can use your insatiable
talent and highly pressurized drive to influence and ultimately mutate the collective. Opportunities
for success on your journey through life are dependent upon the quality of your relationships and
networks. Informing before you act on your decisions can lessen or remove the resistance from
others. As long as you stay connected to your intuitive awareness in each decision you will stay on
track with your unique life and purpose, and find the peace that you yearn for. The signposts that you
are letting your not-self mind override your instincts and personal Authority are over-committing
in order to prove your worth or keep the peace in your life and relationships, and not keeping proper
boundaries. Intimate relationships can become a preoccupation, and you can go from one partner to
the next as you eventually find something wrong with each one. You have keen instincts and are very
quick with your words, but letting your mind and emotions override your instincts is detrimental to
your well-being.

You are a Generator, and you were born to work and to love your work. Your gift in life is to perfect
or master a task, project or skill. Your gift to the planet is the life force energy that you generate from
your Sacral Center. When you are engaged in your correct work, you experience deep satisfaction. In
order for you to find the work that will bring satisfaction, it is important for you to ‘know’ yourself,
and the truest path to knowing yourself is responding to life rather than initiating.

When you respond you engage your Sacral Center in everything you do. Your Sacral Center is
the key to your happiness and satisfaction. The only way to truly know what is correct for you is
by allowing your Sacral Center to be your guide for making decisions. To fully surrender to your
Sacral’s built in navigation system, you must remain available to respond. Something or someone in
your life asks you for your energy, and your Sacral connects its energy to what is correct for your life
purpose. In order for you to follow your Sacral, however, you must surrender every picture you have
in your mind about what your life ‘should’ look like. And your mind in particular is very open to the
ideas and opinions of others. You have a rhythm, however, and a direction in life that is very unique
to you, and when you stay true to it, you can also influence and mutate the rhythm and direction of
those around you as well.

A Sacral response is a non-verbal sound from the gut. A yes is ‘ah-huh, which means you have the
energy needed for the task, and a no is ‘uhn-uh,’ meaning you do not have the energy to commit.
Sometimes you will not have a response at all, which indicates either you do not have the energy, or
perhaps you have not been asked the correct question. Once your Sacral responds ah-huh and you
are engaged in an activity, you then go through a step-by-step perfecting and building process. You
must cover all the steps in your process. You don't have a motor connected to your Throat Center
though (which is the gear shift for your design), and so you will hit plateaus along the way. At each
of these plateaus you will need to be initiated again by a new insight, or new input or questions to
respond to. Then, depending upon your response, you can engage in your work again.

When you do not follow your Strategy and Authority — when you do not wait for life to come to
you to respond and then honor the truth of that response — you experience resistance in your life.
You experience what your mind thinks of as your ‘not-self which means it is asking you to act like
someone else. Frustration is the not-self theme of a Generator, and is an important signpost for you.
Frustration comes from either meeting internal or external resistance, and noticing your frustration
lets you know when it’s time to check in with yourself and see if you are pushing, or initiating,
rather than responding. You can quit prematurely out of frustration if you do not understand what is
happening. Trusting your Sacral responses instead of making decisions with your mind can be a bit
frightening at first. Over time though you will get to know your body’s intelligence. One of the great
fears Generators have is “Will I be asked?” You have it built into your design, into the mechanics of
your form, that you will be asked so that you ‘can’ respond, Your aura is open and enveloping, and it
pulls to you everything you need in life. All you need to do is sit back and watch what your Sacral
responds to, or not.

Your Profile, the costume you wear in the world, is the 5/1, or Heretic Investigator. Your profile is
the role you play in life so that your purpose can express itself, and you are here to investigate things
deeply. Your role on the planet is very trans-personal, and you have the potential to universalize new
and practical solutions for others in a very public way. There is an unconscious part of you that feels
320 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE

NCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

insecure without a firm foundation though, and so you respond first to deeply investigating life,
and to discovering what authorities you can rely on. Eventually all of your research and study will
turn you into an authority yourself, and then you will feel comfortable universalizing what you have
learned to the public.

‘The Heretic part of your profile is very seductive, and draws people to you who project onto you that
you can help or save them with your out-of-the-box practical solutions. You will also feel yourself at
times projecting onto others that you can indeed save them. It is important that you do not initiate,
however, and that you wait to be asked and answer yes only if your Sacral responds ah-huh. Your
Sacral will know if this is the correct time for you to offer your heresy, and for others to follow you in
it. Your power to help others is more as a stranger of consequence. You are designed to step in when
really needed and then step back out again. People expect you to deliver the goods, so preparation
and a solid knowledge base is crucial for your success and satisfaction, otherwise your reputation will
suffer. You want to leave them wanting more!

‘The consistent energy that people experience from you is made up of the three defined channels
in your design. The Channel of Mutation (60-3), which connects your Root Center to your Sacral
Center, is a very individual energy that fluctuates and initiates in an on/off pulse manner. This is
very creative and mutative energy, but you are not in control of the timing of the pulse, and you can
spend a lot of time wondering when the next moment of creativity will show itself. You can even
experience depression when it feels like nothing new and creative is happening in your life. This is a
a deep process of surrender, however, and melancholy and moodiness are also a part of it. If you try
and give a reason for your moods, however, or to change them, you only make it harder on yourself.
‘There is no reason, it’s just the mechanical pulse of your individual, creative and mutative process.
Your energy is also very empowering to others, and can mutate them in a new direction as well, so
it is important that you let your Sacral response guide you to those situations where people are truly
ready for the mutation that you potentially bring.

You are designed to sustain your own creative efforts, or materially provide for and encourage
people in their own creative endeavors. The Channel of the Beat (14-2) is an unconscious energy
that connects your Sacral motor to your G Center. This is very individual energy that empowers
through example, and so your first task is to be true to yourself. Wait for life to come to you and
show you potentials that you cannot even imagine — remain open and responsive to life. If you
attempt to chase after or create your destiny, you will end up feeling lost and frustrated. This
energy is also about being the Keeper of Keys, the one who has the resources to turn the engine
on and move in a new direction. It is only when you are asked, however, that you will know what
that key or direction is.

You also have a magnetic presence that pulls others into your aura, your timing and your flow.
‘Through your Channel of Rhythm, also connecting your Sacral to your G Center (5-15), you are
constantly moved along by the river of life, vitally and intimately connected to its continuous flow.
You appear to others to have your own sense of timing which is determined entirely by your own
inner rhythm. And if the patterns or routines you are living are natural and correct for you, then you
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 321

should allow nothing to interfere with them. If you live out the distortions and incorrect timing of
the not-self, however, you will find yourself disrupting everyone's flow, beginning with your own.
You are always in the right timing and flow when you follow your Sacral response.

You have six Undefined Centers in your design, including the Head, Ajna, Throat, Heart, Spleen
and Solar Plexus. These are the areas within you that are open to the conditioning of others, and
you are very sensitive to what is going on in your environment. This openness can distract you from
your own response and flow in life. What is going on outside of you can have you thinking about
questions that don't matter to you (open Head Center), or trying to answer everyone else’s questions
(open Ajna Center). In truth you have a very open mind that can become very wise about what
questions and answers really have value to you personally, and to others when you universalize them.
You can become very wise about what solutions have true practical value, and do the research to
support your answers. It is only by waiting to be asked and then responding, however, that you will
know what answer has value or not.

‘Through your open Throat Center you can find yourself talking too much in order to attract attention,
or to prove your worth (open Heart Center). You may feel pressured to know what you are going to
do next, or to jump in to try and save people in order to prove your value to others. Once again, you
have tremendous resources available energetically that will support you personally, and allow you to
support others as well, but you will only have access to these resources when the timing is correct.
And you will only know this if you respond from your Sacral, rather than react from your mind.
You have the potential to become very wise about what really does have value to the public, and to
express it in a creative and empowering way.

You may also find your not-self holding onto things that are not healthy for you (open Splenic
Center) and avoiding confrontation and truth (open Solar Plexus Center). Your personal Sacral
authority operates in the moment, and your truth is available to you immediately through your
response. If you do not speak your truth in the moment however, because you are afraid that it will
affect your security, or upset someone else, you cannot stay true to your own rhythm and direction.
Although it may feel confrontational to speak your truth, this is the greatest asset that you bring to
the collective. You are a true heretic who will find new solutions for the issues that we all face. You
are designed to understand what people need, and to attract attention in order to communicate and
universalize something new to the world.

Everything you do in life that is not a Sacral response is a distraction from what you are here to
do, from the unique life purpose that only you can live out in the world. This life purpose only
finds you though when you do not initiate, but rather wait to respond. Through your investigations,
and practical understanding of others, you have the potential to succeed in life and to bring a new
revolutionary pattern and flow to society's creative process. You have the ability to organize and
empower others to develop their own skills, and to tap into their own creativity. You have a knack
and capacity for expressing details which can bring discovery and metamorphosis to the public. By
staying in your own flow, and responding honestly to what life brings to you, you will experience the
satisfaction that is a signpost that all is well in your world.

You are a Manifesting Generator, a warrior buddha who can move very quickly into action. Your gift
is to discover through action how to make whatever you are focused on more efficient. In order to
know what action is correct for you however, you must be a buddha first and sit under that tree and
wait for life to come to you. Your Strategy in life is to wait to be asked for your energy so that you
can hear and feel your Sacral response. Your Sacral Center is designed to respond through sounds
that come from your gut as either an ‘ah-huh’ for yes or ‘uhn-uh’ for no. Or you may respond by
actually moving into action. Your responses are based on the availability, or not, of your Sacral energy
to connect to and do what you have been asked.

Your defined Sacral Center is here to work and, more importantly, to love the work you do to the
point of completely using up your energy every day. Doing work that you love brings you a deep
feeling of satisfaction. The correct work actually transforms your life and slows the degenerative
process. It is very important for you to know yourself and understand your own process for finding
the correct work, and you do this through responding. You can move directly from response to
manifestation, which allows you to see the steps that are essential, and the steps that can be skipped.
‘This gift of efficiency creates a dilemma for you, however, as you can have a tendency to be so
impatient, and move through a task so fast, that you miss steps. You sometimes have to go back
and complete those missed steps. You can avoid this frustration, however, and actually increase your
efficiency if you slow down enough to pay more attention to your responses as your process unfolds.
It also helps for you to make lists.

In addition to waiting to be asked for your energy so that you can respond, you also need to wait over
time to know what your actual response, or truth, is. Your defined Solar Plexus is your Authority
and it has a frequency, a wave, that takes time to get you to a point of emotional clarity. Until you
reach a calmer place in your wave, you are not ultimately sure if the responses your Sacral is having
are your final truth. In other words, your truth comes to you over time, when you have had time to
process and ‘surf’ your wave. Without waiting for emotional clarity, you can end up jumping into
and out of things too quickly which creates regrets, crisis and conflict in your life. Once you respond
to something, it is very important to wait and allow yourself time to process your feelings. You are
designed to take in the world and your experiences deeply. This is not a life to be lived at a superficial
level. Take your time, and when your emotions clear, you will know your response and decision.
Often your first response is the ultimate one, but by waiting you gain more information, and you
allow the correct timing for the action you are about to take to show itself.

‘The costume you wear in the world, the role that you are here to play, is that of the Martyr Heretic.
You are designed to learn about life through trial and error. Life bumps into you and you discover
what does not work. You consciously experiment with life so that others who follow you can learn
from your discoveries. And when you discover a practical and generally heretical solution that does
work, you are able to step in with great power and conviction and speak out or stand up for what you
believe. You do not necessarily conform to an established attitude, doctrine or principle, and it may
take courage to step up and express an unpopular truth, but you are wired to take the heat. You are
extremely resilient and adaptable, and as a heretical agent of change your trial and error process does
not indicate failure, but rather the potential that something useful and helpful can be discovered and
universalized. For you, the only failure is ignoring the discoveries that each trial and error brings you.
3240 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

As a Heretic you also have a very magnetic and trans-personal aura, and others project onto you
that you can somehow be helpful or save them. You can also begin to feel like the invisible person
who is only visible when needed, and as soon as you have saved the day, you are invisible again. This
can cause you to believe the projection field, and initiate so that you can feel valuable and needed. It
is important to be aware of the projection and to be practical in your own life. If these expectations
are not met, your reputation can suffer so wait to be asked for your help. You are someone who can
bring helpful solutions to others, but only after you have had time to master the world in your own
way through discovering what does not work. When you wait to respond, and give yourself time to
emotionally process your decisions, you will bump into the right situations that will lead you to the
discoveries that can be of actual help to others when they really do need you.

You have a Split definition in your design. This means that you have two parts of your energy that
can feel like they operate independently from each other. The channels that connect your Solar
Plexus, Throat and Ajna Center are one half of the Split. The channels that connect your Root,
Spleen, Sacral and G Centers are the other.

‘The open gates that can bridge your Split are important for you as you can be conditioned greatly
through them. When you are operating from your not-self, these gates put you under pressure to
initiate leading (Gate 7 - The Role of Self); pressure you to act in the now (Gate 20 - Contemplation,
The Now); pressure you to initiate conflict (Gate 6 - Conflict, Friction); and pressure you to go
searching for the spirit in life (Gate 55 - Abundance, Spirit). If you initiate, rather than waiting to
respond over time, you create resistance in your life, you get involved in the wrong romantic and
intimate encounters that lead to conflict, and you provoke the wrong spirit from life. Initiating can
also result in you getting involved in incorrect leadership roles, and in acting spontaneously in the
now, which is contrary to your personal Authority of waiting for emotional clarity.

When you align with your Strategy and Authority you respond over time, giving yourselfan opportunity
for clarity. Then you can get involved in the correct intimate relationships and the correct conflicts. You
can discover the spirit in life that is correct for you, lead others correctly when it is appropriate, and
‘contemplate’ and observe in the moment, rather than ‘act’ in the moment spontaneously.

You have a lot of life force energy that you put out to others through the channels that are defined
in your design. The Channel of Mutation (60-3) that runs between the Root and Sacral Centers is
an energy that fluctuates and initiates. You are very creative and mutative, but this energy operates in
an on/off pulse. There is always the possibility for some new creative impulse to come out of you, or
through you for others, but you are not in control of the timing of this. You can spend a lot of time
wondering, and even depressed about, when the next pulse of creativity will show itself. It is important
for you to accept the limitation inherent in this process by simply surrendering and waiting for the
next pulse of creativity. Melancholy and moodiness are also a part of this process. When you try and
give a reason to your moods you enter into the world of the not-self. There is no reason for the timing
of mutation; it’s simply the pulse of the individual and creative process.

The Channel of Struggle (38-28) runs between your Root and Splenic Centers. You have the
stubborn determination to go your own way in life against even the most overwhelming odds. You
are here to discover meaning and a purpose in the struggles you meet along your unique path. There
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 325

is nothing more satisfying or healthy for you than to stubbornly stand up against the odds, or even
risk losing a sense of security, for some cause you feel is worth fighting for, when correct to do so.
‘This ‘struggle’ gives your life meaning. Your personal search for what makes your life worthwhile,
and your unique struggles, are examples that push and empower others. Your energy encourages
them to struggle with the need to pursue their own individuation process and search for deeper
life purpose. This prodding is not always comfortable for you though, or well received by others, so
don't let your mind choose your battles. You need to respond to struggles in order for them to have
value for you. There is internal stress that can build up in you, when you cannot adequately explain
or correctly live out the struggles you have engaged in, that creates an excess of energy in the body.
Regular exercise releases that pressure so it can move through you in a healthy way.

You are also here to follow your own convictions no matter how unusual they are. The Channel of
Exploration (34-10), that runs between your Sacral and G Centers only operates correctly if you act
and behave as yourself, despite any interference and without guilt. The guidance and timing of your
Sacral’s responses are what make it possible to follow your convictions in satisfying ways. When you
live authentically, you demonstrate to others the benefits of perfecting their own behavior through
response. And you empower others to get in touch with their own conviction to love themselves.

Your open and enveloping Generator aura combined with the Channel of Exploration can attract
a great deal of attention. Whether or not this attention is positive is completely dependent on your
willingness to patiently tune in to your correct timing and responses. When you do, you are living
the true potential for empowerment and mutation that only Individuality can bring into the world.
‘The opposite not-self expression of this channel (not operating through response) is very rigid, and
can sound selfish and self-centered: “I’m going to be like this whether you like it or not. You can be
any way you please, just don't interfere with me and my way.”

You are driven to seek experiences which promise something new and better in life through the
Channel of Transitoriness (36-35) which runs between your Solar Plexus and Throat Centers. This
is your emotional wave, and you are designed to be a “Jack of all trades” who is on an emotional
journey to gather wisdom experientially. You are pushed along through life by the constantly
changing perspectives of your unaware wave, and you can become volatile, or feel let down, if a
new experience fails to meet your expectations. The secret is to embrace and accept your emotional
swings, give yourself time to make emotionally clear decisions, and surrender to fully living each
correct experience in the moment, simply for its own sake, without expectation.

Over time, and with maturity, your experiences will culminate as emotional depth, as your personal
truth. The core of this truth is accepting life for what it is. If you find yourself nervous or uneasy
about committing to a venture, take advantage of waiting out your wave. It may be a lifesaver. As
you learn over time that feelings are transitory, your advice to others will be to “seize the moment,”
and to partake in each promising new experience that is correct, rather than live with a sense that
nothing in life ever amounts to anything. Your great accomplishment in life is that you will have
tasted, touched and felt many things from which you gleaned wisdom of great value. This is wisdom
that you make available to others in the form of stories. You inspire people with tales of your exploits,
and your sense of fulfillment in the richness of a life well lived, to enjoy their own experiences.
326 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Your creativity, and style of presentation, can be magical as you weave together your ideas and stories,
even your jokes, from your catalog of philosophical reflections on what it means to be a human being
experiencing life. Through the Channel of Curiosity (11-56) that runs between your Throat and
Ajna Centers, you have an enviable gift for taking a sequence of ideas, and fashioning a story out of
it that can teach or entertain an audience. Even if these stories are somewhat exaggerated or contain
some half truths, like a child telling you about his day at school, you still draw others in and stimulate
them. Your capacity to believe in something makes it true for you because you are less interested
in facts than you are in how your stories illustrate and teach. Your stories are more like parables,
or discourses on life. Even though they flow from your personal experiences and discoveries, your
stories are not as useful a guide for you, however, as they are for others. Your stories are to be shared,
collected, and stored for reflection and interpretation by present and future generations.

You have two Undefined Centers in your design, the Head and the Heart, that can be distractions
for you. Your completely open Head Center pressures you to search for the next inspirational idea,
and to think about questions that don’t really matter to you. The wisdom that you can develop,
through responding to life and waiting for emotional clarity, is to discern which questions do matter,
and to know who or what is inspirational. Your Undefined Heart causes you to try and prove your
worth by making promises you don't have the willpower to keep. You are under pressure to be the
first, and the best, and to try and control the circumstances of whatever you have committed to.
You have nothing to prove to yourself or anyone else, however, and over-committing to things, and
making promises you cannot keep, puts tremendous pressure on your heart. The best way for you
to get involved in things is through your Strategy of responding and your Authority of waiting for
emotional clarity.

In summary, you are designed to be an influential, creative, mutative, determined, experiential
storyteller. Adventure, determination and exploration are what drive you. You will want to do things
in your own way, discovering something new as you go through life, and attracting the attention of
others along the way. You will operate by your own rules or laws, providing leadership by standing
up against the odds for what you believe in. Adversity motivates you and you are designed to have
and share many experiences in this life.

Others will be inspired by your determined self-sufficiency and expression. Your creative bursts
come and go, and are a big part of your life as they fuel everything you do. When you initiate, or
jump into situations too quickly, you end up involved in the wrong intimacies and romances. When
you fall into the trap of thinking you have to prove yourself, remember that there is tremendous
power in your aura, and it operates correctly through responding and waiting for emotional clarity.
Your aura pulls people to you. You don't have to ‘do’ anything. It is built into your design that you
will attract the correct relationships, struggles and adventures which will be the grist for your later
storytelling. In the end, this is what brings you satisfaction.

57-20 THE BRAIN WAVE, A DESIGN OF PENETRATING AWARENESS
51-25 INITIATION, A DESIGN OF NEEDING TO BE FIRST
328 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

As a Projector you are designed with an absolute drive within you to integrate with the other, not
out of neediness, but rather an extraordinary curiosity. This curiosity is a part of the way your aura
works because you have the ability to penetrate to the self, or to the identity, of the other. You have
a keen ability to ‘read’ the energy of others, and instinctively know where and how best their energy
can be utilized. This is your great gift as a Projector, being able to recognize others.

Your gift as an intuitive guide for others only works properly, however, when you too have been
recognized by those you are here to guide; only when you have been invited to share what you sense
and know. It is very tempting for you to initiate and offer your guidance before it has been invited,
but when you do, you will generally experience resistance and feel bitter about the encounter. You
have a very penetrating and powerful aura, and it draws people to you. By trusting and surrendering
to your design, you are allowing life to provide you with what you need. The keys for you are to allow
your aura to naturally attract people to you who recognize you, and to move through life without
an agenda. The moment you carry an agenda (want a particular outcome) you set yourself up for
bitterness. Just show up and see what happens.

Invitations from others are very important for you. All of the significant things in life come to you
through an invitation. It’s not just any invitation though. It must contain recognition. You must feel
recognized when invited. You must feel ‘seen’ by the invitation. When people really get you, or see
you for your natural gifts, then you will feel successful in your life. When you try to get invited or
recognized, you meet with resistance and feel bitter. This is a signpost that you can recognize for
yourself when you initiate rather than wait. The invitation can also come through another person, as
for example a friend who calls or emails or invites you to consider something they think you might
like to attend.

And yet, all invitations are not correct for you either. How do you decide which invitations are
delicious for you and which are not? Your aura as a Projector penetrates deeply into others, so
deeply it is almost as if you are consuming them. If the invitation is not delicious, therefore, it is
not correct. Decisions are everything in life; they are our navigation system. Each decision we make
takes us in one direction or another. Decisions made from your authentic self mean that you will live
an authentic life. When you make decisions based on ‘shoulds’ you are making decisions based on
conditioning by others. Your Authority is how you make decisions as yourself.

‘The part of your design that you can trust to make correct decisions as yourself is your Splenic
Center. The Spleen is an ‘in-the-now’ type of Authority. The Spleen is about survival, and its primary
job is to keep you safe and alive. This is a very existential awareness, and when your Spleen speaks
or nudges you, it is critical that you listen in that moment. The information you will hear will not
be repeated, and it is spoken in the quiet little voice of your intuition, but is very important. As a
projector you naturally have a strong intellect, and your mind will try and override your Spleen.
‘The mind loves to come up with reasons for this and that. The Spleen does not operate as a mental
reason-making center. It is simply instinctive awareness; it just knows. If you allow your mind to
override your instincts, you end up in the emergency room saying “I knew that was going to happen.”
In order for your life to operate correctly you must trust your Splenic Center and its messages, in the
moment. They are your truth.
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 329

One of the beautiful gifts that you bring to other people is your ability to probe and ask questions,
without wanting or desiring a particular answer. You are able to just be present to the truth of the
other — to ‘their’ truth, not what you think their truth is or should be. This is a very transformational
and empowering experience for the person on the receiving end of your questions. The potential
transformation only happens, however, when you can operate without an agenda.

Your Profile, the costume you wear and the role you play in life, is that of a Role Model Hermit.
Time is required for you to emerge as a role model who lives your authentic self. You have a unique
three-stage life process. The first 30 years or so are a very subjective time of trial and error experiences
in life. The second stage from the age of 30 to 50 is a time of objective observation. You climb up
on the roof, so to speak, and take a look around and review the first 30 years. You sense that you
are being observed even while you are observing others; this is how you become a sounding board
for society’s insatiable curiosity about humanity. And it gives you great trans-personal power, and
becomes an attracting force in your life.

After the age of 50 you flower into a role model for others. It’s time for you to come back off the
roof and into the world so you can live among the rest of us and show us how it’s done. This is a very
special time for you, not unlike a rebirth, but with all of the wisdom you have acquired, and now it’s
time to use that wisdom to experience life in a new way. The rest of us look to you as an example of
self-mastery and personal leadership in terms of how to live as a conscious and aware person who
has transcended both the subjective and objective. The Hermit side of you is very happy to sit home
and just do its own thing. You really do not understand how you do what you do in life, but as a Role
Model, as someone who lives as your authentic self, your process is complete when you are called out
to apply what you naturally do well.

You have a split in your design, which means that there are two separate areas in your design that
are not connected to each other. One area is the Splenic Center connected to the Throat by the
Channel of the Brain Wave, A Design of Penetrating Awareness (57-20). You have a spontaneous
voice that is combined with incredibly sharp intuition. You have the ability to adapt and improvise
in the moment or ‘think on your feet.’ To truly utilize this gift there are two things to know. First,
you must overcome your fear of the unknown and learn how to trust your intuition. Second, you
need to be alert for the invitation to speak that expresses your existential knowing as wisdom for
others. In this way you can avoid being misunderstood or ignored. Listen to, trust and act on your
intuition in the moment. It is so important for you to be tuned into the present moment and not
distracted by the dictates and reason-making of the mind. If ignored, the moment will pass and
you will suffer for it.

‘The other part of your split is where the Heart is connected to the G Center via the Channel of
Initiation, A Design of Needing to be First (51-25). It is simply the nature of your individuality to be
competitive, and you arouse or empower competitiveness in others. When invited, competitiveness
or shock can push you into the unknown to stretch, test and even transcend your normal limits and
endurance. This is a true ‘leap into the void’ because the outcome is never guaranteed. When you
triumph, however, you get a new sense of personal, even mystical power within yourself which, with
your gutsy ways of achieving your personal goals, becomes an example of courage for others.
330 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

You also express yourself through creativity. When invited, initiation for you becomes art as your
nature is to recognize both the potential for mutation in others, and the need to empower others
toward it because mutation cannot remain isolated and still retain its viability. On the mystical
level you are the shaman, a specially gifted innocent who artfully initiates a quantum leap toward
individuation and self-awareness.

Because you have a Split Definition in your design, there can be a feeling in you that something is
missing. In order to resolve this feeling, you tend to initiate, going out into life looking for someone
or something to resolve the feeling. You end up making decisions with your mind rather than your
Splenic Center. Remember, your decisions guide your life and if you are navigating without your
Authority then you are heading in the wrong direction, meeting the wrong people, and ending up
in the wrong environments. And then this split in your design ends up confusing you. The key is to
relax, trust and allow life to bring you what you need; to stop seeking.

As a Split Definition, you are naturally designed to have partners in your life. Your natural partners
will bridge your split and give you a healthy sense of completion or wholeness. In order for you to
have the right people in your life, it is important that you follow your Strategy and Authority when
entering into, when being invited into, relationships. You will have many relationships throughout
your life, and eventually you will be able to teach the rest of us about relationships in general.

In your design there are three gates which can potentially bridge your split. These open gates become
strong areas of conditioning for you as you feel you need to live them out in order to be complete.
When you do live through these open gates, however, you end up making decisions from your not-
self as they are not you. Not-self decisions can play out in your life through Gate 7 (‘The Role of the
Self) by you initiating to see how you can lead others or how you can be a better leader. Your not-self
mind will be focused on developing your creativity and self-expression as an artist through Gate 1
(Self-Expression); and how you should behave in the world and how you love yourself through Gate
10 (The Behavior of Self).

‘These three themes will be the focus of your life. These open places that bridge the two areas in your
design will push you to initiate, and to try to be noticed and recognized, which will usually lead to
resistance and then bitterness. The truth is, once you surrender to your Strategy and Authority, these
three themes become areas in your life where you become very wise. Through observing those who
bridge your split, you become wise about ways to love yourself, to creatively express yourself, and to
best lead others when invited. Your choice is to struggle down the road, trying to initiate, and hitting
your head against the wall of resistance, or you can simply surrender and allow your design to take
you down your unique path toward wisdom.

You have five undefined Centers in your design where you also can become very wise. Our definition
is ‘us’as the student and our undefined Centers are ‘where’ we go to school. You are someone who is
very ‘open-minded.’ And you have the potential to mentally process life logically, or abstractly, or even
with just a very individual knowing, depending on who you are with. Your undefined Head Center,
however, pressures you to answer life's questions, and to chase after one inspiring thing after another.
‘This is an endless and exhausting quest. The wisdom for you with an undefined Head Center is to
learn to discern which questions are worthy of your attention. Your undefined Ajna Center pushes you
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 331

to want to be certain about things in life. You have a fear that you will look stupid if you don’t have
the answers, so you try to find the answers that you can be certain about. The wisdom here is to learn
to allow concepts to float through you without getting attached to any of them, and to be ok with the
statement “I don’t know.” Eventually you will become very wise about which concepts have value or not.

You can get so detached from your body with an undefined Head and Ajna Centers that you are
completely out of touch with your Splenic Authority. When you find yourself getting lost in your
thoughts, bring yourself back into your body because this is where your true self-guidance resides.
Your Strategy and Authority are your navigator in this.

Your undefined Sacral Center causes you to over-do, over-commit, work too hard and to potentially
be obsessed with sex. You must realize that you are not designed as an energy type. You are designed
to guide others who have the energy, but not to ‘do’ it all yourself. It is very easy for you to fall into
the trap of doing too much, which leads to exhaustion and eventual ill health. The wisdom for your
undefined Sacral Center is to know when enough is enough. Listening to your body-consciousness
(Spleen) is the key to keeping you healthy.

Your undefined Solar Plexus Center causes you to avoid confrontation and truth by trying to be nice,
and not rock the boat and make waves. You are open and vulnerable to the emotional climate around
you, and your tendency is to personalize what you are feeling. To avoid these feelings, you create a
‘nice persona’ that you present to the world. This, of course, is not the real you. The wisdom with an
open Solar Plexus Center is to allow the feelings of others to pass through without personalizing
them. To be empathic without personally taking on the emotions, and to stand up for yourself when
it is important to do so. Speaking your Splenic Authority, your truth, in the moment is vital for you,
even if it does feel like you are confronting the other person. The best advice is to state your truth as
simply that — your truth — and not make it about the other person.

Your undefined Root Center takes in all the pressure of the world, and you are in a constant hurry
to get things done so that you can relax. This pressure is constant, however, and every time you
get one thing done, another thing is right there putting you under pressure again. You can get
caught up in a vicious cycle of hurry, hurry, hurry which can lead to adrenal burn out. The wisdom
with an Undefined Root is to feel the pressure and not react to it. Learn to procrastinate. By not
reacting immediately, simply to relieve the pressure, you can then discern through your Strategy
and Authority which thing really does need your attention. This way the pressure and adrenal
speed can support you rather than burn you out.

When you don’t succumb to the distractions of the openness in your design, you can then allow
your body-consciousness (Spleen) to be your personal guide in life. It is totally capable of taking
care of you through every twist and turn that life presents, always making sure you are in the right
place at the right time. And once you are navigating correctly, your Incarnation Cross can come
into its fullest expression.

You were born on the Incarnation Cross of Individualism. As a Role Model Hermit and Projector,
you are here to demonstrate to others how they can uniquely be themselves without worrying
about fitting into the status quo; that it is ok to be themselves and step out of the box of collective
332 - THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

homogenization. First though, you have to learn to be absolutely true to your own uniqueness. Once
you have mastered this, you will then have the trans-personal impact on others that you are designed
for. It’s a special gift in life to demonstrate what it means to be yourself; to be uniquely you. You
have to walk your life first, sort out how to do it for yourself, and then you can be an example or role
model for others.

In summary, after gaining life experience through trial and error, and then objective observation,
you become a wise role model. You are here to live in the present moment, operating through life
intuitively in the now, and when invited, to initiate and empower others to be uniquely themselves.
You are designed to be provocative, to fight for your right to be yourself, and to provoke others into
finding their spirit and purpose in life. You are here to allow your natural calling in life to emerge
spontaneously, and to make creative, unique, influential contributions through your stimulating
storytelling abilities. You are designed to overcome your fear of intimacy, your fear that no one is
listening, and your fears of confrontation. You are not designed to let outside pressures run your life.
You must keep an open mind about yourself and the world, and not get too fixed on any one idea or
concept. You will have creative bursts of energy, and your own unique extreme rhythms. Be aware of
over doing and working too hard. You are designed to be a caring soul, but not so much so that you
create co-dependencies. You have a natural gift for solving problems when invited to do so.

When you begin to use your Strategy and Authority to guide your life, and you live as yourself,
you will experience the parts of you that have been conditioned by the outside world dropping
away. Your transcendence begins with you experimenting with your Strategy and Authority, and
ends with you feeling a sense of success with your life.

334 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

As a Reflector, you were born with a special attunement to the cosmic environment, and to the
impact of the planetary transit field. Manifestors, Generators and Projectors are solar types,
meaning their purpose ‘shines’ through them. As the only lunar Type, you are designed to operate
as a lunar reflection of the sun’s programming, and to reflect the neutrino imprinting processes.
Like the moon, your ‘glow’ is subtle yet wields substantial influence, especially when it is detected or
noted by others. You are here to sample and be one with the totality, and through this process you
can have a mystical life that most of us will never know. You have the potential to easily connect to
celestial bodies in an ongoing and profound way, particularly the Moon. You are very tuned in to the
“Program” and as planets move through the solar system you are picking up what is going on, and
reporting back to the rest of us. In many respects, you are a key to understanding and participating in
global consciousness, because your extraordinary openness is continually filtering this consciousness
field in a potentially unbiased way.

In the day to day world, the people you associate with, and the physical, mental, emotional and
spiritual environment you are in, is vitally important to your well-being at all levels. Like a canary in
a coal mine, you naturally sample, reflect, judge and discern the quality of the environment and the
people around you. When you are healthy and happy and thriving, you know that the environment
is too. And when you are not thriving, then the environment needs to be changed in some way or it
is not the right environment for you.

You have the ability to sense who is living authentically, and who has been conditioned by the
transit field or become a victim of it. When people allow their lives to be conditioned by the transits,
or those around them, they move away from fulfilling their unique potential. You can sense those
who are ready to become their own authority, and when a community or organization is operating
correctly. You can feel the physical, psychic or emotional health of an environment or group. As
people awaken to their true selves, you can be there, ready to share or reflect what is needed at the
time. This is how you become ‘visible.’

Your nine undefined centers sample, magnify and reflect the frequencies of everything and everyone
in your environment; in a way no one else can, you give others the potential to also taste or sense
what is really happening. Your unusual aura allows you to appraise or read the auras of others as
they pass through yours, without taking in the frequencies too deeply. When not personalizing what
comes in through your openness, you have the capacity to reflect everything around you with perfect
equanimity. This is a gift that uniquely equips you to discern if and when a person is ready to step out
and express their own uniqueness, their difference, rather than remain absorbed in the homogenized
world of the not-self.

Your openness is an exceptional window to wisdom, if you just allow everything to flow through
you and simply sample it as it does. Your “Teflon” aura will protect you from identifying personally
with anything that is going on in the world, and you can detect a blip in the collective energy, or
something or someone that is unusual or out of line around you. As you become familiar with your
design and understand it, you can avoid yielding to the pressures of society to conform. You are here
to enliven and lift up the energy of others through the rather extraordinary way that you amplify
and mirror their energy back to them. Your unique aptitude to facilitate an experience of heightened
awareness of the other in a non-judgemental way, and the unimposing, non-intrusive nature of your
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 335

auric presence, also makes you a particularly effective facilitator of the group process. All of this
remains only a potential for you, however, until you are able to operate as yourself rather than as an
amplified version of the homogenized world around you.

Unfortunately, most Reflectors live a homogenized life, trying to be something they are not simply
because they have not been understood or encouraged to embrace their difference. Too often, finding
the world unreceptive, cold and disappointing, they give in to others’ expectations in order to survive.
When you begin to appreciate your uniqueness and practice detachment from (or not identifying
with) what you are mirroring, you will be less apt to become lost, confused and caught up in the
turmoil around you. You can then accept your place in the center, rather than feel invisible and on
the outside looking in.

In the Mandala above you can see how the 64 gates wrap around your chart, and each gate brings
the potential for a different type of activation. As the Moon travels through your chart, over the
course of 28 days, it passes through each of the 64 gates. This pattern repeats itself every month,
336_ INE

Book OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

however, each day within the month is different for you and you can find yourself asking, “Who
am I today?” and “Will I be surprised, included or invisible?” The monthly pattern of the moon
through your chart is something that you can learn to know and rely on, providing you with a
unique sense of consistency.

Your decision-making Strategy in life is to simply sit back, enjoy life, and wait for something to be
presented to you. You then need to wait through a full 28-day cycle of the moon (from that moment)
before you make a decision. As you wait through this cycle you can talk with others, not to seek
advice, but rather to hear your own potential truth reflected through you. Use others as a sounding
board. These others need to be confidantes that you can trust to simply listen, or perhaps ask a few
questions, to help you articulate your thoughts and feelings. They are not here to influence or make
the decision for you. Over time you will begin to get the clarity you need to make your own decision.
If you still do not have clarity after the full cycle of the moon, then just continue to wait. It is not
healthy for you to be rushed. As a matter of fact, most Reflectors have been rushed all their lives, and
their health begins to breakdown from pushing against the natural flow of life; the resistance has an
impact on their bodies. If you live as yourself, however, and do not personalize the energies that shift
and flow through your open centers, you can experience a life filled with surprise and joy and the
wonder of the moment. For further detail about the Moon Cycle, see Section Four, Reflector.

Place is key for you. Finding the right environment to call home within the right community is one
of the most important decisions you face. With your undefined G Center it’s helpful for you to know
that other people are here to initiate you, to introduce you to new people and places. Once you have
been introduced, it is your job to be discerning. Your correct place is in the heart of a community so
that you can freely sample and reflect the auric information of those around you. This is where you
fulfill your purpose. You are here to be accepting of others, and to reflect and teach the rest of us that
most often what we judge as good or bad in the world is just a revelation of our diversity.

You must also remain free to leave the group or gathering if you realize that your reflections will
not be solicited. If you stay in an unhealthy environment for any length of time, you may take on
that energy and get sick or become drained of your vitality. It’s essential for you to have a dedicated,
creative space of your own, a place where you can take time alone to shake off the conditioning you
are exposed to on a daily basis. If you don't, you can easily become dependent on the energies of
people around you, which is also why you must select, with care, the people you allow into your inner
circle of friends and family.

Your Profile or the Costume you wear in life is a 2/4, or what we call the Hermit Opportunist.
Often called the missionary profile, the 2/4 combines the natural aptitudes and genius of your
conscious Personality (Line 2), with your unconscious Design (Line 4) that is transpersonal and
always ready to interact with the world in order to externalize what your natural talents can do.
‘The push and pull between the conscious Hermit (antisocial) and the unconscious Opportunist
(social) brings an interesting dynamic to your life. There is a pressure within to share what you
know, as long as it does not require you to investigate or train to suit someone else’s expectations.
Others are watching, but you're uncertain what they see. You are unaware of your own gifts until
someone else points them out to you. You project out to others what you can do simply by staying
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 337

absorbed in your own process, and enjoying what comes naturally to you. At the same time, you
unconsciously draw people in to befriend who will tell you what they see in you. This is how you
get your ‘calling’ in life.

Ifyou stay the Hermit, in the sense of not letting anyone else corrupt your natural process, eventually
someone will call your true gifts out into the world. Answering ‘the call’ is a transformative, self-
actualizing force, which comes forth naturally when you are making decisions as yourself. You
are not a pursuer, however, and ‘friendship first’ best describes your healthy process of easing into
intimate and lasting relationships, as well as the way proper business commitments or partnerships
are entered into. Your social and business networks are very important because these are the
communities where your calling finds you. Once you receive the correct call, you can go forth with
the zeal of a missionary to spread your influence or understanding or knowing into the community.

All nine Centers are undefined in your design. Each open center allows you to take in and read the
energy of others, and to scan the environment from an objective vantage point while remaining open
to the unexpected. What you take in from others and the environment is not personal, however, and
your objectivity only works correctly when you are open and fluid with life. The moment you try and
hold on is the moment when you will feel disappointment.

Your undefined mind can get distracted thinking about things that really do not matter to you. You
can get so detached from your body with an undefined Head and Ajna that you can be completely
out of touch with your Lunar Authority. When you find yourself getting lost in your thoughts,
bring yourself back into your body. Your open Head Center puts you under pressure to answer all
of life’s questions, and to chase endlessly from one inspiring thing to another. You can feel lost in
the confusion, and this can be an endless and exhausting quest. The wisdom potential is to learn to
discern which questions are worthy of your attention, and to use your Strategy and Authority as
your guide. Your open Ajna Center pushes you to want to be mentally certain about life. There is a
fear that you will look stupid if you don’t have the answers, so you try to find the answers that you
can be certain about. You can also get caught up in irrationally focusing on finding a rational for
what is past. The wisdom potential is to learn to allow concepts to float through without getting
attached to any of them, and to be ok with the statement, “I don’t know.”

Your undefined Throat can cause you to try to attract attention by doing or talking too much. An
undefined Throat Center is like a megaphone screaming out into the world “Look at me” or “Watch
me.” There is nothing you need to ‘do’ to attract attention, as it is already built into your design, so
sit back and relax. Notice how you feel pressured to do or talk, but don’t act on it; just observe it and
see what happens. You may also find yourself feeling socially cautious, or the opposite, wanting to
express reflections to the group before it is time. The wisdom potential is that by observing, you will
be the judge or wise one who knows who has something worthwhile to say or do, or not. You will be
able to communicate, when it is correct for you, the higher principles of the community, even if it is
coming through your very unique perspective.

Your undefined G Center gives you the feeling that you must find out who you are, and where
you are going in life. This sensation can cause you to make mental decisions about what direction
to go in, and what your role is in the community. There is something really special about having
338 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

an undefined G Center. Your environment is filled with ‘signposts’ to show you the way. These
signposts come in any form, such as a person or something you read or hear. You are a natural role
model who can act out the highest values and ideals for the community, and identify the weak
points of the group. Your identity and the roles you play in life change constantly, however, and
it’s important that you learn how to be fluid with these changes. If you get attached to one way
of seeing yourself or to one role, when it changes you can experience a lot of pain by attempting
to hold on to a role that is no longer yours. The wisdom potential is to trust that you will be given
the next signpost for the new direction and role when the time is right.

Your undefined Heart Center can push you to try to prove your worth, and this can play out in
many ways. You might try to prove yourself by constantly trying to improve yourself, or by over
compensating and making promises. With an undefined Heart there is no consistent access to
will power, and you cannot will yourself into being or doing better. Your life is not about willing
yourself to do anything. What you get involved with needs to come from your Strategy and
Authority, not your will. Your life motto is “I have nothing to prove to myself or anyone else.”
‘The wisdom with an undefined Heart is that you can objectively read the ego of the other, and
know who can keep their promises or not, and who has a healthy ego or not. As important as
community is to you, if you are not with the right people, you would rather be alone.

Your Undefined Sacral causes you to over-do, over-commit, work too hard and potentially be
obsessed with sex. You can feel an uncontrollable drive to say yes to new experiences, or to expand
beyond what you have the resources for or the energy to finish. And even though you have an
instinct to nurture and care for the other, you must realize that you are not designed as an energy
type. You are designed to be the observer and judge, but not to do it all yourself. It is very easy for
you to fall into the trap of doing too much, which will lead to exhaustion and eventual ill health. The
wisdom potential is to know when enough is enough. Slowing down and making decisions slowly

and carefully is the key to keeping yourself healthy.

Your undefined Spleen can cause you to hold onto things that are not healthy for you, or to become
dependent on something that makes you feel good. You have the capacity at times to focus in on the
detail and maintain your grip, so to speak, but that does not mean it is necessarily correct for you,
such as staying in a job or relationship long after it should be over. Holding onto things gives you a
false sense of security, even to the point of staying in an abusive relationship because you are unsure
what the alternative is. You are also not designed to be spontaneous or make decisions quickly, and
the wisdom potential is that once you step back and view life objectively, you can see what is healthy
for you or not. This includes people, places and food. As a 4th line, you are not designed to leave
one relationship before the next one appears, so be sensitive to the timing of any decision that you
make. Following your Strategy and Authority allows the universe to also arrange the much needed
replacement for whatever it is you are letting go of. You cannot find the replacement yourself.

Your undefined Solar Plexus Center causes you to avoid confrontation and truth by trying to be
nice, and avoiding making waves or rocking the boat. You are open and vulnerable to the emotional
climate around you, and the tendency is to personalize what you are feeling. To avoid these feelings
you create a ‘nice persona’ that you present to the world. Of course, this is not the real you. You are
very sensitive to the true spiritual needs of those around you, and can help to balance the awareness
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 339

and energy of the community. The wisdom potential is to allow these feelings to pass through
without personalizing them; to be empathic without taking on the emotions and feelings of others;
and to stand up for yourself and the principles of the group when it is important to do so.

Your undefined Root Center takes in all of the pressures of the world, and you are in a constant
hurry to get things done so that you can rest. Even though you may feel cautious about how you
use your energy, especially in terms of other people's desires for you, the pressure is constant. Every
time you get one thing done, another thing is right there putting you under pressure again. You
can get caught up in a vicious cycle of hurry, hurry, hurry, which can lead to adrenal burnout. The
wisdom potential is to feel the pressure and not react to it. By not reacting to it, by procrastinating
so to speak, you can then discern through your Strategy and Authority which thing really does need
your attention. In this way, the pressure can actually support and fuel you, rather than burn you out.
Remember, as a Reflector it is extremely important and healthy for you to take your time to process
information and potential decisions. It is not in any way healthy for you to be rushed.

To summarize, you are designed to enjoy the daily surprises that life offers, and to stay as unattached
as possible to how your mind ‘thinks life should be.’ You are here to be fluid. You were born under
the Incarnation Cross of the Unexpected. You are designed for the unexpected, for the surprises
that your Reflector type flourishes with, and for the unexpected and empowering ‘call’ that your 2/4
Profile is here to live out. All of these pieces fit nicely together. You are an influential and caring
person, who can share with all of us a vision for the future, and a purpose for being alive. And you
can demonstrate to people through your reflections how to be accepting of whatever ‘is’ in each
moment. The most important things for you to remember are to slow down and take as much time
as possible for every decision, ideally a month; to not allow outside pressure to drive you; and to let
go of fixedness and welcome the fluidity of surprise into your life. For the Reflector who is living
according to Strategy and Authority, the magic is that more will always be revealed.

SECTION TEN
HEXAGRAM LINE DESCRIPTIONS

A DEEPER EXPLORATION

The Rave ’Ching, completed in December 1989 by Ra Uru Hu, is a synthesis of the descriptions
for each Hexagram (Gate), a list of the Incarnation Crosses associated with it, and a description
of the 6 lines associated with each Gate. There are 64 hexagrams and 384 lines in the Rave
TChing. For the purposes of this book this section lists only the 384 lines. For a copy of the Rave
T’Ching please visit one of the authorized Human Design National Organizations; a listing can
be found in Section Eleven.

375 of the Lines express a polarity of potential experiences, which is termed either an exaltation or a
detriment, and is indicated by the black triangle symbol A (exaltation) or the white triangle symbol V
(detriment). These terms when used in standard astrology indicate good (exaltation) and bad (detriment),
but The Human Design System does not make this moral distinction. In Human Design, these terms
simply denote the ‘this’ and ‘that’ polarity.

A person's design is the sum of its parts, and when looking at a specific component such as a line,
we need to consider it in relationship to the entire chart. If you pull just one detail out to examine
it, without considering the whole of the rest of the design including type, strategy, authority,
profile, cross, centers, channels and gates, you take it out of context. To truly understand a line,
always step back and see it in the context of the bigger picture; the holistic view. What you will
find as you begin to study charts is that there is a “genetic continuity,” an unfolding pattern. The
pieces have a theme that relate back to the full design, and you begin to see a theme for the life.
You also begin to see the paradox in the life, and all of its complexities.

It takes time to understand lines; they may seem abstract, or like riddles or poetry. Just as the
T’'Ching (Chinese Book of Changes) can take a lifetime to understand, the lines take time to
digest in the context of the entire chart. It’s best to start with your own chart and spend time
with, even meditate on, your own lines over time. Even the recognitions that you may have in
the moment about a line, or the way the description resonates in you, will evolve as you journey
deeper and deeper into your own experiment with living your design.

You will find your lines next to your gates in the red (Design) and black (Personality) columns on
your chart,¢.g., Gate 50.1 is Gate 50 Line 1. Look for your lines by Gate in this section, and read both
descriptions (exaltation and detriment) to get a sense of the meaning of the lines in your design. Pay
attention to both the name of the line and the description, as each contain valuable information about
the line. Additionally, the description for Line 1 in each Hexagram will give you the foundational
understanding of that specific Gate.
SECTION TEN: HEXAGRAM LINE DESCRIPTIONS, A DEEPER EXPLORATION 343

Some lines, not all, have a one-sentence introductory description in italics. When there is a
description in italics it means that this is a theme you have an opportunity to learn about and
potentially grow into. If there is no description in italics, then this characteristic is a given; it’s
hard wired into your design.

Within the exaltation and detriment descriptions, the first sentence in regular type is the original
meaning as received by Ra. The second sentence in bold is a subsequent description that Ra
synthesized years later to further clarify the meaning of the lines. You will also see that there are
planet glyphs associated with the lines — they are listed next to them. Certain planets can “fix” a
line in either exaltation or detriment. If you look at your own chart, you will see that there are
exaltations and detriments displayed next to some of the Gates and lines. In some cases, you may
find a chart that has no fixing — no exaltation or detriment.

When we speak of exaltation and detriment in the context of “fixing” in a chart this is simply
another way of saying “this” and “that”. There is no judgment here of good or bad. The detriments
in your design are also perfect for you in the continuity of your overall design. In fact, it is generally
in the detriments that we have the greatest opportunity to learn. Composite charts (your design
combined with another) and transits (planets moving through our designs over time) can also fix
our lines. There is also fixing that can take place through the harmonic gate at the other end of
a channel. These areas are complex and best suited for an advanced discussion at another time.

Start by looking up each of your Gates and Lines in this section. Then read the description
line in italics if there is one and contemplate the lesson that you are here to learn. Read the
line descriptions themselves and feel the flow of energy that moves from the exaltation to the
detriment. See what recognitions you have. If you have an exaltation in your chart then read the
exalted line knowing that this energy will be emphasized in your design. If you have a detriment
then read the detriment for its emphasis in your design. If you have a juxtaposition (a star shaped
symbol representing both the exaltation and detriment), then both descriptions apply.

The enlightened Father figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a
generation by its influence. The pressure to know that may result in influence and wisdom.
A tendency in power to want to enforce compliance to ensure lasting influence. The
pressure in knowing to resent challenges and demand acceptance.

Line 4 - Research

The capacity of concentration to explore the depths of inner truth and maximize its
application to fundamental principles. The pressure to know the fundamental principles.
Where the tendency to expansion and integration leads to involving others in the research
and may end in a diversity of confusing applications. The illusion that collaboration will
enhance inspiration.

Line 3 - Interdependence

It is exceedingly difficult for truth to stand alone.

‘The ability to establish relationships for the actualization of truths, and through their
nurturing and protective power to ensure a stable environment in which they can continue
to grow. The pressure to know enhanced through collaboration.

With an abundance of energy and in possession of a truth, the tendency to leave others
behind or be crushed by their resistance. Impatience with others and the forsaking of
relationships.

Line 2 - Natural brilliance

The Moon exalted, and so gifted by this position a far-reaching, a nourishing influence,
free of guile and powerfully attractive. A gift for inspiration that is both attractive and
beneficial to others.

‘That in early recognition of its influence becomes ego obsessed with maximizing its
effects. A delusion that any inspiration deserves recognition.

Line 1 - Occult knowledge

A natural psychic awareness that empowers principles of universalization. The pressure
to know the mysteries through esoterics.

Where a reliance on secret knowledge increasingly demands ascetic withdrawal and leads
eventually to obscurity. Where the pressure to know the mysteries can be so strong that
one can be eventually incapable of handling exoteric realities.

SECTION TEN: HEXAGRAM LINE DESCRIPTIONS, A DEEPER EXPLORATION 405

GATE 62: THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL - DETAILS
— Caution, patience and detail produce excellence out of limitation —

Line 6 - Self-discipline

A penny saved is a penny earned. Detail as the path to material success. The understanding
that material success depends on the expression of detail.

‘The skills but not the discipline to succeed. The gift for, but not the discipline, to do the
necessary detail work to succeed.

Line 5 - Metamorphosis

When excellence is achieved, action is necessary.

The reaching out to others to share, symbolized by the Moon's phases as it moves from
darkness to eventually sharing fully its light. The understanding that only when the
details are complete can action or expression be initiated.

A tendency in metamorphosis to seek acclaim through dramatic presentation. When the
details are organized, the need for attention demands expression.

Line 4 - Asceticism

‘The perfected ascetic withdrawal in the pursuit of harmony and simplicity, where outside
dangers do not exist, and there is time to pursue inner meaning in detail. Detail that can
only be expressed after periods of isolation and reflection.

‘The urge to take action against established values that when restrained by circumstances,
leads to withdrawal that waits for opportunity. Where the detail is organized, isolation
as a strategy waiting for the right opportunity for expression.

Line 3 - Discovery

A genius for the unusual. The ability to discover valuable information in detail work
and to find innovative applications for this knowledge. The unusual gift of finding and
expressing valuable details.

A dissatisfaction with the monotony of detail work, where what is missed may be of great
importance and value. The expression of dissatisfaction and boredom in detail work.

Line 2 - Restraint

‘The innate restrictiveness and discipline to comply with and exalt restraint. The discipline
necessary for detail work.

‘The intellect stymied by severe restraints tends to anxiety and restlessness. The expression
of anxiety and restlessness when faced with detail work.

Line 1 - Routine

‘The ability to transcend the boredom of routine through a rich and daring fantasy life.
‘The ability to organize the detail through fantasy.

Rebellion and its enormous waste of energy. The need for expression which ignores the

details.
406

THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

GATE 63: AFTER COMPLETION - DOUBT
—In the spiral of life, all ends are beginnings —

Line 6 - Nostalgia

‘The good sense to avoid turning the previous struggle into an obsession. The logic of
leaving old doubts behind.

Revolutionary nostalgia. Iogic and the potential obsession with old suspicions and doubt.

Line 5 - Affirmation

The authority and sincerity of purpose to pursue the same values in the new beginning
that had allowed it to transcend the old. The understanding that doubts are necessary
and of value.

A tendency in triumph to pay lip service to such values, and given such leadership, these
values will be reduced to nothing more than empty rituals. Doubting one’s very process
despite understanding.

Line 4- Memory

The detailed accounting of the achievement process whose information base can prepare
a new order for the future. The pressure to explore the doubt in detail as a foundation for
eventual formulizing.

A willingness to forget in the glow of victory, with a possible price to be paid later. The
pressure and risk to forget the details when the doubts have been answered.

Line 3 - Continuance

‘The dedication to the new beginning that insists on maintaining its achieved principles
despite having to interact with those who have not attained such a state. Doubts that one
can maintain one’s principles when interacting with others.

Success at any price. The pressure to eliminate the doubt at any cost.

Line 2 - Structuring

‘The establishing of a large framework through which achievement can be expanded
and shared; compensating others for their contributions while maintaining control of
direction. The pressure to share one’s doubts with others while still maintaining control.
Instability in achievement that when in positions of authority leads to arrogance and the
desire to keep others away from the center of power. Doubts in achievement that can lead
to suspicion of others.

Line 1 - Composure

‘The quality of personality where achievement is accepted with equanimity and where
continued development is allowed to take its natural course. Acceptance of achievement
but doubt whether continued development will take place.

‘The tendency in achievement to immediately seek new goals at the risk of destabilizing
what has already been accomplished. The pressure in achievement to still doubt one’s
capacities and to immediately seek new goals.
SECTION TEN: HEXAGRAM LINE DESCRIPTIONS, A DEEPER EXPLORATION 407

GATE 64: BEFORE COMPLETION - CONFUSION
~— Transition, like birth, requires a determined strength for the passage through —

Line 6 - Victory

¥ A The mental assuredness, that knew that victory was inevitable, thus making triumph sweet
but not reason for excess. The mental gift of enjoying the confusion and its diversity of
data.

 V Like the story of the Trojan Horse, it can be dangerous to get carried away in celebration,
least one looses vigilance and perspective. With all the diversity of data, it is easy to lose
perspective.

Line 5 - Promise

2 A The values promised in any new order are demonstrated through harmonic interactions
with others. This strengthens the justification for the struggle. Confusion over which
values and relationships can bring harmony.

4% V A tendency in trying to justify the struggle by focusing exclusively on the failure of the old
order that cannot demonstrate the quality of the new. Focusing on the past confusions
about values and relationships.

Line 4 - Conviction
D A Symbolized by its phases, the Moon is assured of transition convinced by its very process
that it will triumph. The assuredness that confusion is a process that results in realization.
V Where force and energy alone cannot overcome doubt. Where the confusion is so
energized, assuredness brings no relief.

Line 3 - Overextension

1} A Thewisdom to recognize when one has not the necessary resources to complete transition.
Such timely awareness may give it a chance to seek assistance. The wisdom to accept
confusion as a temporary state, that will be resolved in time or through others.

DV. The risk of a superficially confident personality that when transition collapses, there is no
one to turn to. Overconfidence that the Fates will be kind on demand.

Line 2 - Qualification

2 A An inner development which recognizes what qualities are essential for transcendence
and the awareness that without them, action will fail. Inner development that can end
the confusion over what makes sense.

D V Constantly in action, it wastes the very qualities and resources that it will need. Getting
lost in the confusion and burdening the psyche.

Line 1 - Conditions

2 A In penetrating to the center, the understanding that instills the necessary harmony to
survive disorder. Amongst the confusion, the difficulty in finding the point.

& VY The powerful temptation when having transition in sight, to hasty action. An urge to act
when you think you have made sense of the confusion.

APPENDIX C

AREAS OF STUDY AND INTEREST AVAILABLE IN
THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM

CHART ANALYSIS.

‘This fundamental and powerful initial reading is your entry point into discovering yourself. It is a true
journey of self-empowerment. You will be offered insight into your Strategy, your Authority and the
characteristics of your design. You will gain an understanding of why you are here, the potential of your
unique contribution, how to express your true self and life purpose, and how to authentically live your
design. Each of us has a unique way in which we are designed to transform. You will discover your
road map to transcending your conditioning, and learn how to tap into your unique decision-making
process. The Human Design System is an incredible tool for self-observation as you continue down
your own path of self-discovery, and will help you to identify the challenges you will face along the way,
and how best to work with them in your day to day life.

CYCLES ANALYSIS

There are several key juncture points that happen for all of us at specific times in our lives. These
transition points usually arrive with major life decisions, and important lessons about the trajectory
of your path. The more knowledge you have about yourself, the better equipped you will be to make
these important decisions during sometimes challenging times. These cycles include the Saturn
Return around age 28, the Uranus Opposition around age 40, the Kiron Return around age 49, and
the annual Solar Return three months before your birthday every year. Cycle readings equip you
with insights and signposts, a weather report so to speak, to make these transitions as smooth as
possible, and keep you on track.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS.

We are all designed differently, and we all deserve to be honored and supported to be our unique
selves. When a couple understands themselves from the vantage point of their individual designs
as well as their combined design, there is the potential for a relationship based on authenticity,
compassion, acceptance and respect. In a Partnership reading you will learn how to communicate
one-on-one with your spouse, children, family members, colleagues and friends. The health and well-
being of a relationship can be nurtured correctly when we understand the potential attractions and
compromises that bring us and hold us together, and sometimes push us apart. The Human Design
System illuminates the differences in your designs so that awareness can replace misunderstanding.
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE 413

FAMILY PRACTICE

A Family reading is very beneficial to all members of the family unit, particularly the children. Through
an exploration of the Penta (a group aura of 3 to 5 people), each member can see the dynamics of their
family relationships, and how mechanically these dynamics are always present. When we understand
how the Penta operates, we have the opportunity to create an environment, with no fault or blame, that
accepts and supports the uniqueness of each family member, and the family itself:

CHILD DEVELOPMENT

‘The knowledge of The Human Design System is ultimately for children, and Child Development
teaches the adult how to interact with children in very practical ways that nurture their development.
‘This study includes: the dynamics of the conditioning of both children and parents; what is correct
conditioning; the different types of interaction between the parent and child; what conditioned
parental authority is; the proper nurturing of Generator, Manifestor, Projector and Reflector
children; what the ‘dysfunction’ is; the profiling patterns; and aligning a child with its personality.
‘This is essential information for the well-being and nurturing of children and their families.

BGS AND OC16 CAREER AND BUSINESS CONSULTING

‘The Human Design System is a fascinating way to see into the mechanics of small to large business
group dynamics. BG5 and OC16 focuses on the different energetic natures of human beings, and
what role each is best suited for in terms of the business environment. It explores all aspects of a
functional working team, and the ways single individuals can contribute their personal strengths
to form an effective and efficient greater whole. This study includes detailed information on personal
career profiles, as well as small business group and large corporate business dynamics. It pinpoints specific
strengths and dysfunctions in a working team or group, as well as what is specifically needed in order to
create optimal business performance that plays on the strengths and gifts of the individuals involved.

RAVE PSYCHOLOGY

Rave Psychology holds the key to employing your mind as an ally. When you discover how your
unique cognition works, you are able to create a working partnership between mind and body. The
mind has strategies to cope with the openness in your chart. These strategies attempt to manage
the ever-changing energies that stream into, around and through you. These coping mechanisms
attempt to keep the mind in a dominant position in your life, thus reinforcing the contradiction
between body and mind. Recognition of the correct functioning of your own mind begins by seeing
what is natural to you. Rave Psychology delves into the deepest levels of the way your mind digests
the information it takes in from the world around you. Rave Psychology provides a complete
understanding of the way the human mind works in its fundamental duality, the homogenized mind
and the differentiated mind. Slowly but surely, this understanding permeates the being and leads to
the awakening of passenger consciousness.
414 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

PRIMARY HEALTH SYSTEM (PHS)

What Rave Psychology is to the mind, the Primary Health System is to the body. PHS offers a
revolutionary approach to well-being through the enhancement of the body’s potential through
correct food intake, and finding the correct living environment. PHS teaches us how we are best
designed to take in and digest food for optimal brain function, as well as our overall health and
longevity. The potential effects of following your unique health strategy may include improved
digestion, heightened sensory awareness and brain function, and unique improvements to your
lifestyle.

HOLISTIC ANALYSIS

Holistic Analysis is the integration of PHS (Primary Health System), Rave Psychology, Variable,
Lunar and Planetary Resonance, and Base Orientation knowledge with traditional chart
interpretation. Holistic Analysis is the full realization of the analytical potential of Human Design.

RAVE SOCIOLOGY

‘The greatest force opposing differentiation is conditioning. Rave Sociology is dedicated to exploring
the mechanics of group interaction and its conditioning impact. This is the shadow and the window
on the homogenized world. Understanding these mechanics is the counterpoint to living the
potential of your unique purpose. It is an opportunity to see how you are designed to morph under
the influence of the other, family, classroom, group or the crowd.

DREAMRAVE ANALYSIS

DreamRave Analysis helps us understand how we are vulnerable to conditioning while sleeping.
When sleeping, the higher levels of our 9-centered consciousness simply disappear, and we return
to an ancient 5-centered configuration. This information will change the way dreams have been
interpreted historically; they are not what you would expect.

RAVE COSMOLOGY

Rave Cosmology covers the mysticism and science of The Human Design System. There are several
layers including the Bhan Tugh, the mythology and the mechanics of the ‘Biverse’ as transmitted
by the ‘Voice’; ‘The Mystical Way, Ra Uru Hu’s journey into the framework of Human Spirituality
that offers deep insights into humanity’s relationship to God, and the genetic imperative that
drives us all towards awakening; Dying, Death and Bardo, the most in-depth analysis yet of the
mechanics of dying and death and an extraordinary journey into the mechanics of the ‘Bardo’;
2027, which covers the changing of the cycle we are currently in, and the emergence of the ‘trans-
auric form’, the conscious Penta; Brahma’s Night and Beyond, a look at what awaits humanity in
the future; Profile, Purpose and Function, a look at the ‘patterns in being’ and the ‘complexity of
purpose’; and The Nature of the Stars, which covers the workings of the Neutrino Ocean through
an in-depth look at 11 stars.

APPENDIX F
THE DESIGN OF FORMS

In traditional astrology, an astrological chart would be the same for a chicken or a human. The
extraordinary potential of The Human Design System is that the design of Humans is only one
aspect of the revealed knowledge which included specific Designs for all forms of life down to the
single cell. The interconnectiveness of all forms is illustrated in the following designs.

DESIGN OF MAMMALS

Mammals, like humans, are endowed with two Crystals of Consciousness and a Magnetic Monopole.
All forms of Life, including humans, have a direct impact on each other and can be agents of
conditioning. Throughout the world, mammals have a widespread influence on the day to day lives
of humans. The aura of a house cat is as large as any humans. It is clear from the potential of their
Design that animals can condition our rhythm and direction. Having dogs in our lives is evidence of
that, as they get us up in the morning so that they can pull us along on their leash.

Mammals can also bring beneficial health conditioning through their Splenic Centers. Human
Design is not just about humans. If you are going to bring an animal into your life, it is a good idea
to know their Design. Most breeders have a record of birth, and it would be wise to record individual
birth times rather than one overall birth time for the litter. With accurate data, you can assure a
healthy environment for the animal, and a quality companion for the human.
422 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

APPENDIX G

GLOSSARY OF HUMAN DESIGN TERMS

Abstract:

A quality associated with the channels and gates of the Abstract Circuit: experiences, feelings,
emotions and reflections; making sense of the past for the benefit of the Collective. The opposite
of the Logic process. (see Logic)

Activation:
Any gate that is colored in on the BodyGraph, whether part of a defined channel or not.
Ajna Center:
(see Centers)
Anger:
Not-self theme of Manifestor, or manifested channels. (see Manifestor) (see Channels by Type)
Astrology:

‘The ancient study of stars, planets, heavenly bodies and their influence on one’s life or environment;
precursor to the modern science of astronomy; an astrological calculation provides a snapshot of
the planets’ positions at the time of birth and places it within the synthesis, the Mandala.

Aura:

An invisible energy field that surrounds living creatures, extending about 6 feet in every
direction. Its frequency, or how it communicates who we are to others, governs the way we
impact or connect with others. (see Type)

Authority:
One of the tools for living and making decisions.

Inner (personal) Authority, is the source of inner guidance for making decisions as oneself;
one’s own personal GPS.

Outer Authority, the proper realm of the mind, liberated from decision making and able to use
its gifts in service to others.

Awareness:
A point of transformation/awakening when one becomes an objective observer of one’s life.
Awareness centers:

All human beings are endowed with three potential fields of awareness: Ajna — mind
consciousness; Spleen — body consciousness; Solar Plexus — spirit consciousness. (see Centers)

Awareness frequency:

Each awareness center operates at a different frequency. Ajna — over all time; Spleen — in the
now; Solar Plexus — in a wave over time.

OF THE DESIGN OF FORMS

PLANTS INSECTS BIRDS, REPTILES, FISH

SINGLE CELL INANIMATE

‘There is no Personality Crystal in either the single cell or the Inanimate, but they are both endowed
with Design Crystals and Prime Magnetic Monopoles. The Inanimate without a complete channel,
cannot be biological, yet everything participates in evolution. Everything is linked and interconnected

in this grand movement.

‘This topic is extensive. If you are curious to know more, you will find information about the Design
of Forms at www.jovianarchive.com and www.ihdschool.com.

“THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO THE “VOICE” IS AN UNBORN ENTITY.
EVERYTHING IS PART OF THIS LIFE. IT IS US AND WE ARE IT.” — RA URU HU
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE. 423

Big Bang:
In terms of The Human Design System, the Big Bang is Conception. The coming together of the
original Yin (the Egg) and the great Yang (the Seed), which then initiated the expanding (Growing)
Universe. In the language of the “Voice”, the conception of the “child” which has yet to be born.

Biverse:
A term used by Ra Uru Hu to represent the dualistic nature of the cosmos. (see Binary)
Binary:

Any system that embraces polar opposites as an integral part of its understanding of the whole;
Human Design is based on the juxtaposition of opposites, the ‘this and that’ of everything.

Bitterness:
Not-self theme of Projector, or projected channels. (see Projector) (see Channels by Type)
BodyGraph or Rave BodyGraph ™:

‘The matrix of circuits (channels and gates) and centers, sitting in the middle of the Rave Mandala,
that captures the neutrino imprinting of both the Personality and Design Crystals, and defines one’s
unique differentiation for life; it was drawn for the first time by Ra Uru Hu on January 5, 1987 under
the direction of the Voice. The main tool for Human Design analysis.

Bridging gate:
Any gate activation that links a split in a person’s chart, and defines an otherwise undefined

channel. (see Definition types)
Cartography:

‘The study or mapping of the flow of energy through the channels, gates and centers of the
BodyGraph. (see Circuits/circuitry)

Centers:

Energy hubs of the 9-centered BodyGraph that transform the energy as it circulates through
the BodyGraph; associated with the body’s endocrine system.

Ajna, center of conceptualization; prepares and directs mental awareness towards the Throat.

G, center of identity, love and direction; where we connect with our geometry through our
Magnetic Monopole; the center of the higher self; how we connect to the totality.

Head, center of inspiration; pressure to think and to question.

Heart/Ego, center of the material world, will power, ego strength and self esteem.

Root, center for maintaining momentum for living; adrenalized pressure to get things moving.
Sacral, center of our creative life force energy that operates in response.

Spleen, center of survival awareness connecting us to our animal instincts; existential state of
physical awareness/safety/health in the moment; our immune responses.

Solar Plexus, center of emotional intelligence, the emotional wave; currently undergoing mutation
as an awareness center (spirit awareness) in preparation for the evolutionary shift coming in 2027.
424 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

‘Throat, center of metabolism, manifestation and communication; represents the most significant,
and most recent, mutation of the 7-centered bioform (along with the Ajna); opened the way for
the development of sophisticated verbal communication 85,000 years ago.

Chakras:

7 energy centers used for centuries in the East to relate the energy body to the physical body, the
exoteric to the esoteric realms; in 1781 humans began evolving into our current 9-centered forms.

Channel:

A quantum created by the joining of two gates; pathways that carry or link and transform
energy between the nine centers in the BodyGraph. (see Section Six) (see Appendix F)

Channels by type:
Generator channel, energy designed to respond.
Projector channel, energy designed to be recognized and invited.
Manifestor channel, energy designed to initiate and impact.
Reflector channel, no definition, designed to reflect.

Chart:

BodyGraph. The blueprint for your energy, how it functions within you and how it interacts
with the energy of others. The main tool for Human Design analysis.

Choicelessness:

Allowing your life to unfold with awareness through correct auric interaction with others
(Strategy) guided by the Inner (personal) Authority of your form; the result of choicelessness
is that by observing what life brings to you, and not attempting to control or manipulate it, you
wake up.

Circuits/circuitry:
Organizes and graphs the flow of energy throughout the BodyGraph; 6 circuits within 3 main

circuit groups plus the core Integration Channel; circuitry represents how we connect to and
work with each other. (See Section Six)

Circuit Groups:
‘The three Main Circuit Groups are:

Collective, keynote of sharing; reflecting on what has been, or anticipating what might move
life safely forward, as a large group.

Individual, keynote of empowerment; inspired by intuitive knowing that arises in the now
moment.

Tribal, keynote of support; ensuring continued replication of the species by making provision
for survival; success/vitality on the material and spiritual planes.

Collective Circuit:
(see Circuit Groups)
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE 425

Companionship:

Both partners have the same channel or gate defined in their BodyGraph. This is the potential
for friendship, the shared experience.

Compromise:

One partner defines the whole channel and the other defines only a single gate in the channel.
‘The partner that only has one gate of the channel activated is always compromised by the
partner with the complete channel.

Composite:

‘The integration of two designs; the foundation for relationship is established where definition
exists in the composite. There are four kinds of defining connections. (see Companionship,
Compromise, Dominance, and Electro-Magnetic)

Conception:

‘The vast majority of the Crystals of Consciousness are not incarnated in living forms and never
will. Grouped in “Bundles,” they maintain a continuous planetary consciousness field. In each
of these “bundles” there are specific Crystals, however, that are waiting to incarnate. When not
incarnated, Design Crystals, with their magnetic monopoles embedded within them, cluster
within the mantle of the Earth. Personality Crystals orbit within the Atmosphere. The initiation
of the conception sequence takes place when the Magnetic Monopole and its Design Crystal are
attracted from the “bundle” beneath the Earth’s mantle by the Magnetic Monopole of the male.
‘The attracted Design Crystal enters the male’s Solar Plexus center and lodges in the 6" gate.

At the moment of orgasm, the Design Crystal, now within the single sperm and directed by the
crystal’s Magnetic Monopole, moves through the Channel of Mating and Reproduction (59-6)
from the male Solar Plexus into the female Sacral center, and into the Egg. This is the moment
of Conception, and the initiation of an incarnation cycle. As the Neutrino stream penetrates
the mother, it also penetrates the cell and passes through the cell’s Design Crystal, which then
begins the work of building the body of the child.

Conditioning:
Pressure, expectations or influences from outside sources that are used by the mind to conform

to patterns that are not part of who we are (not-self); adaptive strategies which become habits
and take us away from or repress or conceal our true self and purpose for incarnating.

Conscious:
All of the Personality data, in black on the BodyGraph, that we experience, are aware of, and
identify with.

Crystals of Consciousness:

Every living thing is endowed with two Crystals of Consciousness: the Design Crystal, an
aspect of the original Yin, and the Personality Crystal, an aspect of the original Yang. There
is no Personality Crystal in either the single cell or the inanimate. (see Design, Personality
Crystals)
426 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Cycles:

Key measurable transition points in life. The point itself is the midpoint in a 7-year cycle that
represents a transition process that is traveled through, with Cycle Return Readings providing
signposts for life’s journey. In addition, we also go through a yearly cycle known as our Solar
Return. (See Saturn Return, Uranus Opposition, Kiron Return, )

Solar Return — A weather forecast for what we will be experiencing in the year ahead in terms
of our education, development and personal connections.

Saturn Return — Explores the mechanics and patterns revealed in the BodyGraph between the
ages of 28 to 32 years, and gives us signposts to our evolving maturity.

Uranus opposition — Explores the mechanics and patterns revealed in the BodyGraph, showing
the shift from the direction and environment of the first forty years of our lives, to the new
direction and environment for the second half of our lives. This occurs between ages 38 to 40
years. (mid-life crisis)

Kiron Return — Explores the mechanics and patterns revealed in the BodyGraph for the final
flowering of our purpose in life, starting between the ages of 48 to 52 years.

Definition/defined:

Channels that are colored in within your BodyGraph, and the two gates and centers at either
end of the channel; definition represents what is consistently and reliably you. (see Undefined)

Definition Types:

Represent how energy flows, or is interrupted by gaps in circuitry, between defined areas in a

BodyGraph; Types are: no definition, single, split, triple split, quadruple split. (see Section Five)
Design:

Neutrino imprinting pertaining to the bioform; a consciousness that lies below one’s level

of conscious awareness; recorded in red on a BodyGraph; distinguishes The Human Design
System from all other systems. (see Vehicle)

Design calculation:
88 degrees of the sun prior to the natal (birth) or Personality calculation. (see 88 degrees of the Sun)
Design Crystal:

An aspect of the original Prime Yin that transforms the neutrino data into the body and the
life. Sits in the Ajna Center. (see Vehicle)

Design Sun and Earth:

‘The Sun and Earth of the Design Calculation. They represent the direct inheritance from the
Father (Sun) and the Mother (Earth).

Detriment (V):

One of two energetic influences that can be fixed by a planet, which is then emphasized within
a line. (see Lines)
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE. 427

Disappointment:
Not-self theme of Reflector. (see Reflector)
Dissonance:

In Hexagram Theory, any line relationship that does not create harmony (i.e. 1/4) or resonance
(ie. 1/1) in relationship to another line, is considered in dissonance. There is a conflict or
incongruity between the two lines (i.e. 2/3 or 1/6). (see Harmony and Resonance)

Dominance:

One partner defines the entire channel while the other does not activate (define) either of
the channel's gates. The defined channel can only be accepted and surrendered to as a way to
experience the energy of the other.

Dormant gate:

A gate (in an undefined center) that is alone in a channel, and open to receiving the harmonic
gate via an electromagnetic connection through the aura of another, or a transit.

Driver:

Gate 2 is the seat of the Magnetic Monopole (the Driver), which knows the trajectory of the
vehicle, where the form is going and how to get it there; the Driver is not to be influenced by
the Passenger. (see Magnetic Monopole)
Duality:

‘The universe and everything it contains is dualistic in nature. Humans, through their genetic
structure (DNA/RNA), are also designed as dualistic bio-systems. In physics, the universe
began as a duality with its expansion through Quarks and Leptons. This is our up — down,
in — out, right — wrong reality. In Human Design, the duality is reflected through the two

sets of data (Personality and Design) which determine the uniqueness of an individual in
the BodyGraph.

Ego/Heart Center:
(see Centers)
88 degrees of the Sun:

‘The Personality Crystal, or Soul, is called into the fetus at the moment that the basic structure of
the brain's neocortex is complete and the vehicle is ready to begin its journey of self-consciousness
in form. The time of entry is exactly 88 degrees (88 or 89 days) of the Sun's movement before
birth. Pre-mature births do not alter this formula, but are an indication that the fetus’ neocortex
has developed more rapidly than usual. For most pregnancies, this event takes place at the end of
the second trimester. During the final trimester, the Personality is able to adapt to its new vehicle.
‘The time of birth shows us the potential of the Personality after its period of adaptation.

Electro-Magnetic:

Partners each define one gate (one half) of a channel, thereby defining the entire channel and
creating life force energy; represents the basic dynamic of a relationship, attraction and repulsion.
428 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Emotional wave:

The movement from hope to despair (pain), from high to low; originating in the Solar Plexus,
the wave is experienced in three general ways: as need (Tribal); as uncertainty (Individual); and
as desire (Collective/abstract).

Energy Type/Non-Energy Type:
Energy types are Generators, who have definition in the Sacral, and Manifestors, who have a
defined channel between the Root, Ego, or Solar Plexus Centers and the Throat Center; non-
energy Types are Projectors and Reflectors who lack such definition and consistent access to
motor energy.

Ephemeris:
Astronomical calculations of the positions of the planets, the Sun and the Nodes of the Moon.
Exaltation (A):

One of two energetic influences that can be fixed by a planet, and emphasized within a line. (see
Lines)

Format energies:

Distinctive energies, fueled by the Root Center and guided by the Sacral’s response, that exert
a powerful influence on all other channels in the circuit, and the design as a whole; Format
Channels run between the Root and Sacral Centers: 53-42 (Collective/Abstract), 60-3
(Individual) and 52-9 (Collective/Logical). There is no format channel for the Tribal Circuit.

Form/Form Principle:

Our physical forms; our 9-centered form was the focus of the Voice’s revelation, and the basis
of The Human Design System.

Fractal:

Every human being through their Personality Crystal is linked through a fractal line to
other Personality Crystals. Fractal lines formed at the Big Bang when the prime Crystal of
Consciousness shattered. Information moves down our individual fractal lines. There are 66
fractal lines, 66 archetypal ways in which information moves, and each have nuances that are
fundamentally different from each other. These fractal lines are each associated with a star in
our universe (including our sun) as stars produce neutrinos. Every single star is a data bank of
consciousness, and through its neutrino stream establishes specific lines of moving information.
Every human being is connected to one of these fractals, and to all of the others who share that
fractal line. This creates a sense of familiarity between people the closer they are to each other
on the fractal line.

Frustration:
Not-self theme of Generator, or generated channels. (see Generator) (see Channels by Type)
Gates:

‘The designation given hexagrams when moved from the outer wheel of the Mandala into the
BodyGraph; in the BodyGraph they represent openings into the centers at both ends of a
channel that filter the flow of energy between centers. (see Hexagram)
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE 429

Generator:

One of the four Types; has a defined Sacral Center; here to work and provide life force energy;
Generators comprise approximately 70 percent of the population; embracing and enveloping
aura that operates in response. (see Manifesting Generator) (see Section Four)

Genetic continuity:

A qualitative inter-relatedness that exists in the BodyGraph between similar parts of the whole;
for example, all 1st lines of the 64 hexagrams carry an introspective quality, or all gates in
Individual Circuitry are potentially empowering.

Geometry:

Trajectory, or angle of incarnation, or path in life; the angle is determined by the 88 degree
increments that separate the Personality and Design Sun calculations in a chart. (see Fractals,
Profiles, Incarnation Cross)

Right Angle geometry: personal destiny, self absorbed in own process, less aware of others.

Juxtaposition geometry: fixed fate, a bridging geometry between Right and Left Angles.

Left Angle geometry: transpersonal karmic destiny; intersect with allies to fulfill their destiny.
Hanging gate:

A gate alone in a channel (either dormant in an undefined center, or active in a defined center),

that is open to receiving the harmonic gate via an electromagnetic connection through a transit
or the aura of another.

Harmonic gate:
Term used to describe the relationship between two gates that are opposite each other in a channel.
Harmony:

In Hexagram Theory, lines that occupy parallel positions in the lower and upper trigrams are
in harmony with each other. They represent a common theme. These harmonies are the 1st
and 4th lines (which represent a foundation line for their respective trigrams), the 2nd and 5th
lines (which represent lines of projection) and the 3rd and 6th lines (which represent lines of
mutation). (see Dissonance and Resonance)

Head Center:
(see Centers)
Health Centers:
‘The Spleen and Throat (see Centers)
Heart/Ego Center:
(see Centers)
Hexagram:
A construct of 6 stacked horizontal lines that are either solid (Yang) or broken (Yin); the basis for the

classical ’Ching and the Rave I’Ching; the 64 hexagrams that form the foundation of the ’'Ching
correlate mathematically with the codon structure of our DNA, our genetic makeup. (see Gates)

percent of the population; when invited, based on recognition of specific skills and frequency, can
act as a guide for Generators and Manifestors; aura is focused and penetrating. (see Section Four)

Quantum:
A whole that is greater than the sum of its parts; i.e. a channel, which is made up of two gates.
Rave:
‘The Voice’s word for humans.
Rave BodyGraph™:
In the center of the Rave Mandala; captures the imprinting of the two Crystals of Consciousness
that determine what differentiates one human from all others; a blueprint of uniqueness.
Rave Cartography:
‘The mapping of the surface mechanics of The Human Design System.
Rave Chart:
(see Chart)
Rave Cosmology:

‘The study of the cosmological background/foundations for the revelation of the Science of
Differentiation and The Human Design System; information given Ra Uru Hu by the Voice in
1987 in order to understand the Form Principle and our place in the cosmos.

Rave I’Ching:
A description of the line values of each of the 64 Hexagrams. Completed by Ra Uru Hu on

December 12, 1989 in Frankfurt Germany; based on the ancient Chinese Book of Changes; a
fundamental tool in Human Design analysis. (see ’Ching)

Rave Mandala ™:

Mystical synthesis given to Ra Uru Hu by the Voice; trademark of The Human Design System. Its
formula is comprised of four older systems: Astrology, which frames the BodyGraph’s calculation;
the ?’Ching, which integrates our genetics into the BodyGraph through the Gates; the Hindu
Chakra system, which correlates to the energy hubs of the Centers; and the Kabbalah and its Tree
of Life that corresponds to the circuitry and channels that create life force definition in our designs.

Rave Psychology:
Discipline within The Human Design System that studies the intricacies of the mind, its
potential as an Outer Authority, and the forces of conditioning that influence it.

Receivers:

Areas not defined in a chart (white); open to taking in energy from the environment; how
we are conditioned by others. Single gates are also receivers. (see Senders) (see Dormant and
Hanging Gates)
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE 435

Reflector:

One of the four Types, no definition; connected to the Moon and the Lunar cycle; Reflectors
are 1 percent of the population; have the capacity to sense who is living authentically, and who
has been conditioned by the transit field; aura samples the environment. (see Section Four)

Resistance:
What one meets when one forgets to follow the Strategy of Type. (see Not-self themes)
Resonance:

In Hexagram Theory, whenever a line meets the same line value they have a common theme
and resonate to each other. The resonances in lines are the 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, 5/5 and 6/6. (see
Dissonance and Harmony)

Response:

‘The way Generators aurically interact with life as it comes toward them; Generators are designed
to live their life in response; their strategy is to wait for the response. (see Section Four)

Right Angle Cross:
Personal destiny. (see Incarnation Cross) (see Section Eight)
Root Center:
(see Centers)
Sacral Center:
(see Centers)
Science of Differentiation:

Human Design is the study of our uniqueness, our differentiation; a science which is verified
through our own personal experimentation with its tools for living; it is not a belief system.

Senders:

What is defined in the BodyGraph (colored in); how we aurically communicate our definition, or
who we consistently are, to others; how we condition others through their openness. (see Receivers)

Signatures:
‘The opposite of resistance; what one experiences with the fulfillment of Type and purpose:
surprise for Reflectors
peace for Manifestors
satisfaction for Generators
success for Projectors
Single Cell:

‘The Design of the single cell is the 15" gate in the G Center connected to the 5" gate in the
Sacral Center. Its integrative potential is Gate 3 - Mutation.
436 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN — THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION

Splenic Center (Spleen):
(see Centers)

Solar Plexus Center:
(see Centers)

Strategy:

A logical surrender to our Form, based on our individual Type, that allows our vehicle to
surrender to the flow of life.

Strategy by Type:

Manifestors inform before they initiate action.

Generators wait to be asked so they can respond.

Projectors wait to be recognized and invited.

Reflectors wait through their Lunar Cycle before making a decision.
Tantric channels:

Channels 5-15, 14-2, 29-46 between the Sacral and G Centers; the fertile life forces of the Sacral
empowering identity in a specific direction as an expression of the higher self through the G Center.

‘Throat Center:
(see centers)
Transit:

‘The movement or location of heavenly bodies at a particular time in space; movement around
the Rave Mandala of the Sun, planets and nodes relative to conditioning in the BodyGraph.

‘Transpersonal:

Beyond the personal; in terms of the BodyGraph denotes the interaction with others that is
needed to fulfill one’s life purpose.

‘Trajectory:
Our geometry/movement through space; our path in life and the way we are designed to connect
to others. Governed by the Magnetic Monopole, the Driver.
Tribal Circuit:
(see Circuit Groups)
Trigram:
A construct of 3 stacked horizontal lines that are either solid (Yang) or broken (Yin); two trigrams

stacked on top of each other, an “upper” trigram and a “lower” trigram, form the basis for the 64
hexagrams of the ’'Ching and the Rave I’Ching. (see Hexagram) (see Section Ten)

True Self:

‘The differentiated personal identity that expresses its uniqueness; aware and surrendered to the
mechanics of one’s Design, our true nature free from conditioning.
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MORE _ 437

Type:
‘The world’s population is divided by auras into four Types of human beings, each with a different
strategy for how they best function without resistance: Manifestors, Generators, Projectors and
Reflectors. (see Auras) (see individual Types) (see Section Four)

Unconscious:

All of the pre-natal Design data (88° of the Sun before birth) is experienced unconsciously; the
Design data represents our genetic inheritance; traits that others experience in us and that we
recognize over time; the red in the BodyGraph.

Undefined:

White areas on a chart also described as ‘open’, inconsistent, and flexible places; sources of both
conditioning and wisdom; where we go to school to learn about life; our experience of the other.

(see Defined).

Universe:
According to the “Voice”, a living evolving duality. Not “born” yet, still a fetus within the womb.
The Child. (see Voice) (see Intro and Section One)

Vehicle:
The Design side of the chart; our never-repeated bioform which carries the Personality passenger
consciousness during our lifetime. (see Design/Design Crystal)

Voice, the:

‘The medium of the transmission which gave Ra Uru Hu the information in 1987 that lead to
the creation of The Human Design System. (see Intro and Section One)
Yin/Yang:

Ancient Asian philosophy expressing the concept of the duality of human experience. “Yin
yang” are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic
system; polar opposites that are interconnected and interdependent, and give rise to each other.
Everything has both yin and yang aspects. Yin is the passive female principle in the natural
world, earth, receptive; Yang is the active male principle, sun, creative. Yang is symbolized by the
solid line, Yin by the broken line.

“LOVE YOURSELF” — RA URU HU
| HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT HAS BEEN A LABOR OF LOVE AND
IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRITE DOWN AND RECORD THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
AS RA URU HU WANTED. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE AND WHEN
TO STOP. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO INCLUDE ABOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE. IN
ORDER TO GET THIS OUT INTO THE WORLD WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE.

RA URU HU HAD A WONDERFUL AND UNIQUE WAY ABOUT HIM, AND MANY OF
US WHO HAVE HAD THE GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED
WITH HIM LOVE TO QUOTE HIM. | HOPE THAT BY INCLUDING MANY OF HIS
QUOTES IN THIS BOOK, YOU ALSO HAVE A SENSE OF WHO HE WAS. THIS IS MY
ALL TIME FAVORITE, AND HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR ME. — LYNDA BUNNELL

JOURNEY OF YOUR LIFE?

“It is with great pleasure that I can finally say, here it is. This book is for all those seeking a comprehensive
and authoritative cescapaen of The Human Design System and its formula. This volume sets out the step-
by-step progression of the work from foundation knowledge to the finest nuance of who we are and how we
may encounter our lives as ourselves. To my knowledge, it is the only published work that has enjoyed the
active collaboration of the founder and first student ofthe system, Ra Uru Hu. I cannot recommend it more
highly.” — J.R. Richmond, Chairman, Human Design Standards Board, Sedona, Arizona

“Human Design has blessed me with profound insights about lifelong tendencies. They have given me so
many gifts, especially an awareness of the optimal approach for making my decisions and charting my course.
I SAR invite anyone who is truly dedicated to personal awakening to open themselves to the powerful gifts
of Human Design.” — Dr. Roger Teel, Senior Minister, Mile Hi Church, Lakewood, Colorado

“What would you do if you were given the User’s Manual for YOU? Would you read it? Would you use the
information to change our life? Or would it stay unopened on your bedside table? The Human Design
System is such a User's Manual. It is not a belief system — so there is nothing to believe. It is a concrete map
and a logical way in which you can see yourself. By experimenting with the simple techniques revealed in this
book, you are given a way to live your life authentically as your self. You begin to ground yourself in a way you
have never experienced before. It is the beginning of a cellular transformation that is based in the mechanics
of how your genes operate. It is not about changing who you are, but recognizing who you have always been.”
+ Mary Ann Winiger, Analyst and Teacher, Cheriton, Vigae
